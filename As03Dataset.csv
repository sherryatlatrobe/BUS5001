AVphgVaX1cnluZ0-DR74,Great tablet for the money,5,Amazon,"The Amazon Fire 7 tablet is a great tablet for the money (Got it during Black Friday for $35, but even at $50 is still a good deal). You can get most apps on the Amazon Underground store for free, and most add-ons for the apps are even free, compared to .99 cents each for apple devices. Only drawback for my preference, is that there isn't a facetime app to videochat with other Apple device users with. Other than that, pretty much any other iOS app is available for the Amazon Fire. Videos play very well, not HD quality, but not bad either. This is a great tablet for anyone looking for a portable device to browse the internet, check emails, facebook, etc, and for the price, it can't be matched by any other tablet on the market.",2015-12-28T00:00:00.000Z,SmartShopper

AV1YE_muvKc47QAVgpwE,Awesome device for dumb TV!,4,Amazon Fire Tv,"Great addition to my older ""dumb"" Samsung TV. I'm an Amazon Prime member so it made sense to purchase this to watch Prime Videos. Another great feature is the ability to load and use Playstation Vue app to stream cable television which has allowed me to discontinue my overpriced satellite TV service. My only con, was that the provided voice remote sometimes would lose connectivity and the buttons were rendered useless. Resetting the unit helps, but very annoying. Luckily, there's a Fire TV app for mobile devices for remote control. Overall, I do recommend this product.",2016-10-15T00:00:00.000Z,Phil

AV1YnRtnglJLPUi8IJmV,Amazing e-reader!,5,Amazon,"I'm a traditionalist who loves real books and buys mostly hardcovers. As a consequence, I resisted getting a Kindle for a long time. I'll have to admit now that I wish I'd gotten one sooner. A tremendous amount of research must have gone into the way readers interact with real books, because nothing about the Kindle gets in way of actual reading.",2015-08-23T00:00:00.000Z,Meatka
AVphgVaX1cnluZ0-DR74,"It was faulty, had to contact Amazon",2,Amazon,"Amazon replaced it as it had gray stripes and no picture on the screen. That one works so overall the Fire was a good purchase. Recommend a memory card, it does not hold much.",2017-03-15T00:00:00.000Z,JS123

AV1YE_muvKc47QAVgpwE,Love the Amazon Fire TV box,5,Amazon Fire Tv,"Setup for the Amazon Fire TV box was very easy. I was surprised at how little the box actually was, and just how powerful some of the apps and downloadable games were that you can use on the Amazon Fire TV.I ended up ordering the Amazon Fire TV game controller online at Amazon. I am currently not an Amazon Prime member, but may re-consider that decision in time to get even more functionality out of the box.For anyone looking to buy a relatively cheap device to maximize their TV watching and even Console game playing, look no further than the Amazon Fire TV. Although it does not compare to a Playstation IV or X-Box it does have decent graphics on some of the available games.I had also purchased a class 10 64 GB micro SD card for the Amazon Fire TV Box as well and had no trouble formatting it and getting it setup.",2016-08-27T00:00:00.000Z,NotBlahCoffee

Was this review helpful to you Yes No,3,Amazon,"It's a nice looking cover, will keep the Fire clean, but not particularly safe in a fall. (I have the black one. It is very professional looking.) No padding whatsoever. It does wake the Fire up when opened (and shut down when closed) but that has never been important to me. My problem with all of the cases is that you have to hold the cover out in order to keep the camera clear and it makes clicking the shutter a little awkward. I'd like to see an opening on the front cover that matches up to the opening on the back so you can have it folded in half and still be able to view the subject.",2014-12-02T00:00:00Z,monkcharlie

The best part is that I upgraded the memory with a 64GB SD card so now my available content is awesome!

AVphgVaX1cnluZ0-DR74,Does not work with WowWee MiP app,2,Amazon,"We bought WowWee MiP robots for our grandsons, 8 and 11 years old. They don't have iPad or iPhone in their home. So thoroughly researched what else would work for installing the app. Talked with Best Buy salesperson, who said the app could be loaded via the app store (it can't).Kindle Fire 2015 is included on the WowWee ""compatibility"" list. So we bought them each a brand new Kindle in order to use the app. They had Kindles from earlier years, but these wouldn't support the Bluetooth functionality needed for the robots.ABSOLUTE FAIL. We tried EVERY possible configuration (adult vs child Amazon accounts; Bluetooth on first or off first; MiP on first or off first; etc). It never worked at all ~ not even once.Also tried full factory reset on each device, loading the app via a Google Play account, rather than Amazon Kindle account. Google Play wouldn't load the app; said it wasn't compatible with this Kindle device.Opened a ticket on WowWee. The response was that they've had the same experience - the bluetooth on this Kindle fails and so the app doesn't work with the WowWee robots. They admit it fails, yet it's still on their approved list.So this was an absolute waste of money, tho at least the boys can play some free games we loaded for them.",2015-12-26T00:00:00.000Z,GmaLaLa

AVpf_znpilAPnD_xlvAF,very good fit and some protection for Kindle DX,5,Amazon Digital Services Inc.,"I have several covers, from simple rubber covers to the more expanded package of hard cased plastic rubber Otterbox.I will keep it simple by summing up pro's and con's:PRO's1 Reading comfortThis one is my favorite for when it comes to reading comfort. You can fold the leather cover back to have the 'one page' feel of just the Kindle in your hand, or you can leave it open and then the Kindle reads more like an unfolded book.2 protection on the inside and good to hold for longer periods of timeThe inside is soft to protect the screen, and the outside is real leather - which is a plus to rubber which tends to make the hands more sticky after a while.3 The weight is neglegible the item is very light.4 The hinge system prevents the Kindle to slip out, which no other cover that I know of has5 Elastic band keeps the cover together and indicates 'front' of the device. Many people have complained before that when one opens the Kindle on the back unintentionally, the Kindle could crack at the hinges. By closing it up with the elastic band, you always know where the front is so you never have this problemCON's1 Expensive. That is why I bought it from overstock.com from the marketplace amazon, rather than new from amazon itself2 No total protection. Only an Otterbox case will make sure the Kindle survives a fall on the ground. But for both cases you still need a plastic screen cover to keep the Kindle clean and untouched.Overall If reading comfort is firt priority, and you are careful enough not to damage the Kindle, this is the product for you. If you rather want more safety from damage or scratches, go for the Otterbox, but then the comfortable feel will be compromised for a more heave, rubber 'touch'.",2012-05-20T00:00:00Z,Martijn13Maart1970

AVpe9CMS1cnluZ0-aoC5,High Quality Case For Your Kindle,4,Amazon,"I purchased this Kindle case in the Saddle Tan color. The leather is high quality (it has that wonderful new smell as well) and has beautiful stitching around the border on the front. The case does not add any bulk to the Kindle. I find it quite comfortable to hold in one hand or two, as the front cover folds behind the case, and I truly feel like I am holding an actual book while reading.At the top of the case, there is a plastic arm that pulls upward to reveal a light, which illuminates the screen of the Kindle perfectly in a dark room. My eyes have no trouble reading with the light activated. The light is powered by the Kindle itself, by way of two metal prongs inside the case making contact with two metal tabs on the lower back of the Kindle. The arm for the light does seem a bit delicate, and I could see a young child inadvertently breaking this if care is not shown. I fear that over time, this will be the first piece to stop functioning as the case is regularly used.My only criticism of this case is that there is no way to secure the front cover from opening. It would have been nice to include a clasp, or some kind of stretchable band to keep the case closed. I paid 54 for this case, which is almost as expensive as the Kindle itself. At that price, the designers should have had the forethought to include a means of securing the case from opening. Aside from this potential problem, this Kindle case is perfect, and adds a bit of sophistication to an already awesome device.Kudos, Amazon!",2015-01-09T00:00:00.000Z,Brooks

AV1YnRtnglJLPUi8IJmV,Pretty Great E-Reader,4,Amazon,"If you are someone who enjoys reading for long periods of time, then you will really like the Kindle Paperwhite. The battery life is phenomenal, usually only requiring charging once every 7-10 days with daily reading. The text is very crisp and clear. The backlight is nice for reading in the dark, however you will note a little uneven lighting and a 'ghost' effect of text at times in the background. Overall, I would recommend this to anyone who reads for long periods of time.",2016-03-15T00:00:00.000Z,Fightinirish76
AVphgVaX1cnluZ0-DR74,Storage options are corny,4,Amazon,This is a wonderful e-reader but I hate that you can only store books on the device. It takes up way too much space.,2016-05-13T00:00:00.000Z,stormybaby
AV1YnRtnglJLPUi8IJmV,The best E-reader money can buy,5,Amazon,"I much prefer this over ""multi-purpose"" tablets. The screen is incredibly easy on the eyes. I can read it in bright light as well as in a dark room. It's easy to hold with one hand, plus the UI is very easy to navigate. I love the ability to highlight, make notes, and look up definitions.Did I mention that the charge lasts weeks? After reading one book (about 220 pages in print), I still had plenty of charge left.",2016-03-21T00:00:00.000Z,puffytummy

AVpfl8cLLJeJML43AE3S,Not worth the money or time,1,Amazon,I was excited about the Amazon echo. However after getting it home setting it up and finding out how limiting it is that excitement went away fast. The echo couldn't answer the majority of questions or would be asked a question and instead of answering it would play country music which I never asked for.Unless you have smart home features like a smart thermostat or smart lights etc it is useless aside from being a speaker which for the money it isn't a good speaker.I did however try it for a week finding it not worth it or that googling questions was easier to answer. Even asking it about what movies were near me etc was a pain. Some said maybe I got a defective unit which wasn't the case the echo is just limited in what it can do.I would say save your money this isn't worth it yet.,2017-09-02T00:00:00.000Z,BAdams

AVpfl8cLLJeJML43AE3S,Limited By Accessories,4,Amazon,"All in all it is a great product. However I find it limited by the need and expense for additional accessories. An example is you can call from it but only if the receiving person has a similar device. The sills are tricky to learn, but manageable. Some of the tasks that you ask her can be hard to get correct, it just takes some practice. All in all it is really cool.",2017-06-02T00:00:00.000Z,bdhasson

AVphgVaX1cnluZ0-DR74,So far So good,4,Amazon,I purchased this so that I could use Skype to check on my dogs during the day.

The batter life is very good and the responsiveness for the apps that I use is wonderful. my number one negative is it's continued use of the old industry standard USB cord and socket for charging. My wife often uses the tablet while it is plugged in, which leads to damage to the socket and the connector. This intern will lead to a third rate connection and the eventual inability to charge the device. I'm hoping that the new standard (USB C) will fix this problem in the future. For now, don't use the tablet (or any tablet) while it is plugged in!",2017-01-07T00:00:00.000Z,John

AVpf_znpilAPnD_xlvAF,Great protection if it doesn't damage the Kindle first!,1,Amazon Digital Services Inc.,"This cover is made for the Kindle DX and fits it beautifully. The problem - and it's a big one - is if you accidentlly try to open the cover from the back (which is very easy to do) you can damage the Kindle without even realizing what's happened. My husband did this and cracked the Kindle frame within the first week of owning the device. Fortunately, only the frame was cracked and the Kindle still works. We cannot, however, remove the cover because of the way it hooks into the device, the hook closure must be bent because of the accidental attempt to open the back cover. After the incident, we attempted to clip the back cover to the Kindle, but found this to be cumbersome and the clip would not stay in place. We are just extremely careful now, but the damage was done almost immediately. I hope this design flaw has been fixed.",2012-11-26T00:00:00Z,K.A. Smith

AV1YE_muvKc47QAVgpwE,A Great 'Cutting-the-Cord' Device,4,Amazon Fire Tv,"All the important Apps are loaded on this HDMI device. I can even side-load other Apps and Games that are not already installed on it. Nice BASIC slim remote control that's not loaded with a lot of control buttons. Easy to operate. The remote is also voice activated (I use this feature for checking weather). I use this device for watching Live TV from PlayStation Vue (much cheaper than cable or satellite TV). I like the Fire TV box much better than the Fire TV stick....it's more stable and stronger (has quad core processor, the stick is dual core). If you have strong wifi the stick maybe okay, I kept experiencing buffering issues with the stick. The Fire TV box has an Ethernet port, mini SD slot, and USB port (the stick doesn't). You will need to setup an Amazon account to use the device, but you don't have to put credit card information on it if you don't want to. I didn't give it 5 stars because it is extremely difficult to put batteries in the remote control - VERY difficult to open it.

AV1YnRtnglJLPUi8IJmV,"feels good in the hand, great substitute for book",5,Amazon,"I spend a lot of time looking at a computer screen; when it comes time for leisure reading, it is nice to have relief from bright light. The paperwhite Kindle provides a very eye-friendly experience, with sharp text even at a small size. And there's no struggle with holding open pages of a book. Unlike the Kindle Fire, obviously, it is not a good choice for browsing the web or reading e-mail. Navigation between books is not as easy as I would like; a half screen of 6 recent books, with the other half taken up by ""recommended"" books is not as handy as a full-screen text list of my books would be. But the actual process of reading is easy, and there are a few tools for note taking and seeing how frequently other people highlight sections of text.

AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,The most versatile of all Amazon Echos,5,Amazon Echo,"Full disclosure. I own five Amazon echos including a few Dots as well as this Tap, so obviously I'm a fan of echoes. Honestly I couldn't figure out from Amazons marketing and the online review how the Tap fit in as compared to full blown Echo and the Dot. I kept thinking it was limited compared to the Echo and the Dot because you had to Tap the button to ask it question. However given that it's completely portable and runs for up to six hours on a charge it makes sense that it would wast battery if it was always listening for a voice command. IMO, the Tap sounds just as good and maybe even better the the Echo in a much smaller form factor. Since it's portable it's probably going to be sitting next to you any way so tapping to ask a question is not really an issue and in someways is better when you have a full table as you can control who gets to request music. My friends and I get into fun wars asking for different music on the full blown Echo but it can also get a little annoying when someone plays Michael Bolton over my Bruce Springsteen. Bottom line just as good of sound as the full blown Tap in a portable and smaller form. Very Happy with all my echoes but this may be my favorite.",2016-10-21T00:00:00.000Z,RickR

Amazon also does a lot of advertisements on the tablet for example the lock screen and multiple pages on your home screens which can be rather annoying and unremoveable. Otherwise I used it to watch videos, surf the web and use a few social media apps. Good for kids too both videos and games side.

I added a 32gig micro disk and now store all my Amazon e-books on it (and yes, you can save all your e-books onto the micro disc. Just read the documentation as it's easy to do). While the Silk browser is not the fastest browser in the world it works just fine for my needs. I also added two security apps via the Amazon app store to keep me protected. They seem to work well so far. The screen resolution is acceptable for my needs and while I haven't downloaded any movies yet, I'm confident they will play well. I should also add that I had to separately download an update from Amazon to install Alexa.

AVpfl8cLLJeJML43AE3S,Awesome sound !,5,Amazon,Love the Echo ! Awesome tone to the sound ! Very easy to use I can use this paired thru Bluetooth with my iPhone or I can simply ask Alexa questions. I can access my music from my Spotify or Spotify in general and various other sources. my only recommendation for new products would be to have this be able to be on the charger and then portable not connected to a Wall outlet like the smaller version can be on the charger. However I had the smaller version first and the tone quality and volume were not that great plus i had to get up go across the room to tap it to change anything or ask it anything. the echo you can just talk to it across the room which makes it really easy for you to be lazy ha ha:) I received this as a birthday gift and I really am enjoying it ...highly recommend it!,2016-10-23T00:00:00.000Z,hoppy

It's frustrating that Best Buy and more specifically Amazon, don't let the consumer know on the box or in store advertising that what you're buying is a mini advertising billboard. Why couldn't there be an upfront statement on the box or in the store stating that the ""low price"" is subsidized by all the ads on the device? Would this have changed my purchase? Absolutely!!!! I would have spent a couple bucks more and probably got a Samsung tablet.",2017-01-17T00:00:00.000Z,Freedomlover10

If there was one thing though that I would have Amazon improve upon if they ever release a version 2 is to have the microphone distance be further than whatever it is at now, which seems to be about 10 feet or so. More than 10 feet away, Alexa won't hear me. Other than that though, this thing is awesome. I'm glad I got it.",2016-08-18T00:00:00.000Z,navyvet2010

One caveat that I (or the Best Buy and Geek Squad crews) was unaware of: there is a glitch in the keyboard that prevents it from working properly. Kindle/Amazon are aware of the glitch and will download a third-party keyboard fix to replace the keyboard that's built in to the unit until they are able to fix the problem.

Roku also allows searches of all of your subscribed services. If I am already paying a subscription fee to Netflix or HBO NOW and I can watch a tv show or movie without additional cost why should I pay Amazon to watch it?

These are very good for the price with two flaws: The screen is good and much better than other Android devices at 7"" but not great, and got the 8 Mb version with I would not recommend in hindsight. Because Android's sub-par management on SD cards, got these this year. It has a much better screen, not only larger but with better resolution, adequate speakers for its price, it's fast enough and overall more enjoyable to use. 16 Gb is the minimum I'd recommend, even with SD cards because some apps just work better with internal storage, and some apps even stored in SD will still use some amount of internal storage.It also has Alexa voice support.The main reason for these tablets in my case is the Freetime subscription that has unlimited access to thousands of age-appropriate books, hundreds (or thousand) of free apps and heavily curved web access per age presets. Amazon Fire OS has a decent support for multi-user and in particular kids accounts. My kids are 7 and 9.

AVqVGZNvQMlgsOJE6eUY,LOVE MY KINDLE,5,Amazon,"OK, I was so unsure of this Kindle because it does not have all of the bells and whistles of the others. BUT I am very happy with it. I love my Kindle! I have managed to read a book a week on it sicnce I got if for Christmas. I have been reading the free books on Kindle. There are so many to pick from. While home, I download the books that I want to read and then while I am in the car or waiting at the DMV, I just pull of the book and read. It remembers where I am in the book. This Kindle does not have the back light. I was nervous about that but so far this has not been a problem because the light it has is fine for me. When I am reading in the car, I enlarge the font and it makes seeing the words easier for me. That is the most important factor for me because I can get car sick if I read while riding in the car but with the larger font I don't have that problem. I wear glasses with bifocals and holding this seems to be more comfortable than a book because I can hold it up if I need to. The size is perfect! Again, I can enlarge the font so the smaller screen size really has nothing to do with the readability. Love it!!",2017-02-03T00:00:00.000Z,Cubfan

Our Roku 3, which we've had for over a year, is much smoother and hasn't given us any problems. We also use a Chromecast, which also seems to be less quirky than the FireTV. I have a PS3 in the same room as the FireTV and I find myself going to the PS3 when the FireTV starts to annoy.

AVphLY7v1cnluZ0-_Ty0,Not an Impressive Case One person found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you Yes No,2,Amazon,"Not the best case Amazon has ever put out! I have a number of other Amazon brand Kindle and Kindle Fire cases for my various Kindle devices and this is the least effective of the bunch. It doesn't stand in any position, so I can't use my 6 hands free. It also doesn't line up properly when closed, so the Fire seems to come out of sleep mode, thus draining the battery more quickly. And finally, I have discovered that I do prefer the leather covers over whatever material this is made from. I understand that the cost of a leather case would probably be half the cost of the Kindle Fire HD 6...not that this case was any bargain at 30!!",2015-01-29T00:00:00Z,Diamond Girl

AVqkIdntQMlgsOJE6fuB,"Good, but one small thing annoys me...",4,Amazon,"Purchased this as an upgrade to the first generation Kindle Paperwhite. The backlight is greatly improved, the display is of a higher quality, the words are clearer and the internal process is a lot quicker  opening books and page flipping is noticeably speedier.The one thing that does annoy me about the 3rd generation Paperwhite is the way it's manufactured  when you hold it at a certain angle and you look at the bottom of the screen, you can see a small section of the display covered in the e-ink used to render the words and images on the rest of the screen. At first I thought this was a manufacturing defect, so I took it back to Best Buy and exchanged it for the same model, only to find that the second model had the same issue, except more-visible.This appears to have something to do with the way the display is placed behind the bezel during the manufacturing process. When the Paperwhite first came out, it was the crown jewel of Amazon's e-reader line, and Amazon was careful to precision-craft the devices. Now, that honor falls to the more-expensive Voyage, with the Paperwhite becoming the flagship, but still cheaper, option in the Kindle lineup, meaning the manufacturing quality of the Paperwhite is likely a bit reduced compared to that of the Voyage.This won't be a huge annoyance for some people. It is for me. And it's seriously made me consider whether it's worth contacting Amazon over.For everyone else, though, this is a great e-reader and well worth the money. If you're looking for an e-reader, this is the one to buy.",2015-09-06T00:00:00.000Z,Matthew

AV1YnRtnglJLPUi8IJmV,No regrets with my Kindle Paperwhite.,5,Amazon,"This is my first kindle purchase, and I couldn't be happier with it. Before I bought it I was very concerned that it would be too small for me to enjoy reading on, but my concern was soon expunged. I have always read books, then as I grew older and my eye sight grew worse, I moved to reading on my iPad Air because I could increase the size of the print. The downside to my iPad though, was that it would get heavy to hold as I read, and after a while I would get some eye strain from the light being projected out from the device, even in night mode to a point, even though that was much better. So I decided to try the Kindle Paperwhite with the new 300 ppi type. I couldn't be happier with it. It's light to hold, even in one hand, which I do a lot, I can still adjust the type size to what I want, the type is very crisp and easy to read, and I find that I don't get the eye strain that I used to. One other benefit to the Kindle is that reading outside is even better than reading inside, which can not be said for the iPad.Another benefit to the Kindle is that if I still feel like reading the book for a while on my iPad, using the free Kindle app, my iPad syncs perfectly with my Kindle, so that it will start on the same page that I stopped on with my Kindle, so that I can seamlessly move from one device to the other.The only slight disappointment that I had with it, was that the battery doesn't last as long as they lead you to believe. I found myself having to recharge it about two thirds the way through the book, but realistically that's no big deal to me.If you are debating on whether or not the Kindle Paperwhite would be right for you to read on, my recommendation is to buy it. I don't think that you will be disappointed.",2015-08-05T00:00:00.000Z,Kent

My children are very rough on these tablets and with the cases on them they have not caused any damage to them at all.

AVphgVaX1cnluZ0-DR74,Great value and functionality!,5,Amazon,Great clarity for a tablet of this price point. Amazon provides a great operating system making it easy to maneuver and web surf. The only thing lacking is the camera not making it good for skyping or taking pictures in poor light. However given the dollar per value you can't beat it.

AVpfl8cLLJeJML43AE3S,Love This More Than I Would Have Thought,5,Amazon,"I was in need of a new small speaker for music in the kitchen. The Echo has been a surprisingly awesome addition to my home. You know that best friend in college you listened to music with who had the most extensive selection of bootleg cassette tapes you had ever seen? With my prime account through Amazon, I have spent countless hours playing music long forgotten. ""Amazon, play {insert artist here}..."" and I am reconnected to old music and exposed to new. I love asking Amazon about the weather while making my coffee. The sound quality is fantastic. There is so much that the Echo can do that I have yet to explore. I started using the grocery list this morning and feel like there is more and more to get out of my Echo. I will be buying an Echo for my folks soon- and my teenagers love it. 5 stars!",2016-05-27T00:00:00.000Z,YetiCanRun

This means I am constantantly turning the page or returing to the home screen by accident. It's very annoying, and I have a hard time finding a comfortable way to hold it. It seems like I'm always thinking about where my fingers are. I do not have this problem at all on the Paperwhite.The Paperwhite is a great little reader for the money.

AVpg3q4RLJeJML43TxA_,"Has its selling points and its deal busters, but still good",4,Amazon,"Okay, so I have been debating for days on whether to rate this thing 3 or 4 stars, and I still want to rate it 3 and a half, but I have settled for 4 stars. Here is why.PROSThe only real reason I wanted this case over the others is because every other case holds the Kindle in with straps around the edges, and this is the only case that holds the Kindle in while letting you see the whole front side. It holds it in perfectly, neither feeling loose or too tight to get it out. The black leather is genuine leather and smells nice, and while the front cover is very thin (if you tap on it you get a hollow drum sound, and it can be bent without much effort) it takes mild amounts of abuse without a problem. Also, the flap folds back perfectly and when you are reading, you hardly notice the Kindle has a case on.CONSMy main complaint is the quality of the leather. If you compare this to the case for the Kindle 3 (keyboard) the leather is a little thinner but much less durable. I sometimes lightly hold my Kindle between my teeth when I run out of hands, and after a week I can still see my tooth marks (whereas on the K3 case I couldn't). Also, even a mild scratch will either take several days to disappear. UPDATE: Most scratches will mostly disappear so its not as big a problem as I originally thought.The only other complaint is of course the lack of anything to hold the cover closed, but this has actually not been much of a problem for me. Quite often I like to frisbee toss my Kindle onto a nearby soft surface (like carpet or a pillow or bed) and I was afraid the cover would flap open every time, but 10 times out of the 11 I tried it stayed shut just fine.Read more",,Mark Ingram

AVpjEN4jLJeJML43rpUe,Okay tablet,2,Amazon,Amazon fire is a good tablet if you like e-books. It's also nice to get a six-month subscription to the Washington Post. Their claim to have 16 gigabytes of storage is misleading because it only gives you 5 and then they want to charge you the same amount of money that you paid for the tablet for unlimited storage. Another problem is that you can't flag something as being inappropriate like you can on Samsung Galaxy tablets.,2017-05-27T00:00:00.000Z,Sara

With the cover detached (which is how I use it primarily), the Oasis is so thin that it is almost weightless in your hand. The ability to switch hands (flip upside down) means one never seems to tire of holding the device to read a book; and, it fits into my pants pocket, again, perfect for traveling. The battery seems to last with heavy usage for at least several days, but I tend to reconnect the cover at night (I am assuming that helps to recharge the basic Oasis battery). Regardless, it was well worth replacing our older Kindle readers with the newer Oasis (we bought two).",2017-01-30T00:00:00.000Z,Geno

AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Excellent Sound in a Small Package,5,Amazon Echo,"The Amazon Tap puts out an impressive amount of sound for such a small device. A few things to note if you're not familiar with the Tap or haven't seen it in person:- It's roughly the size of a glass of water- By default, you do have to press the microphone button to talk to Alexa, but as of an update released on Feb 17th, 2017 there is an option in the Alexa app to make the Tap always listen without pushing the button (at the expense of battery life)- The speaker grille is not metal, though it looks like it in pictures. It's a mesh fabric, similar to what you'd feel on the end of some speaker grilles and micrphones. It's firm and comfortable to hold, but if you push hard enough it does flex. - Using a sling or other case will most likely not allow you to use the charging dock, as there is very little room between the tap and the dock for any kind of case.- You can charge the Tap using either the included dock or by plugging any micro USB cable (one is included) into the back of the speaker.",2017-02-24T00:00:00.000Z,TuxToaster

AVphgVaX1cnluZ0-DR74,Good for what it is,3,Amazon,"This is not as cheap feeling as I thought it was going to be. It's definitely not in the iPad class but it's not bad for what it is. I ordered online and did not have one in my hands until mine arrived. Pros: The screen is decent, sound is loud enough for me, no lag scrolling and Real Racing 3 plays smoothly. Cons: The major down side is battery charging time, battery life and built in storage space. When it arrived, it was showing 76% remaining. After less than 2.5 hours use, it had to be charged. I just read where it can take 6 hours or longer to charge. My iPad Air 2 can fully charge in a few hours from 0%. Built in storage is not enough. Yes you can get micro SD cards however some apps will only install on the built in storage. Also, you can not delete Amazon apps without voiding the warranty. And unless I'm missing something, you can't move them either.So if you are looking for something to use casually for web surfing, email, watching movies, reading books and the occasional game, this should be just fine...keeping in mind the battery life and lack of built in storage. But you won't be doing any serious work on this like you can on the iPad's. But to be fair, this is 1/10 the price of my iPad Air 2 and 1/8 the cost of an iPad Mini 4. But I don't believe it's meant to be a direct iPad competitor. Because if it were, it would fail miserably.",2016-11-03T00:00:00.000Z,EPSRedhawk

My kids love talking to Alexa (once she understand them) and I use the timer function all the time while cooking. Only keeps one shopping list and one to-do list but its great to just say something and have it added to a list. Alexa is great for the capabilities she has, but the skills are limited so far so I recommend looking into capabilities or plan on programming your own. For example, she doesn't come out of the box able to read your email even though she can access google calendar. She is also not proactive, such as notifying you of a phone call or email. But overall, fun add-on if you are in the market for a speaker.",2016-06-29T00:00:00.000Z,kmawg

Wanted to get him his own data plan for when we travel longer distances so I attempted to add him to my phone plan. The only problem is the device doesn't have the option to add a sim-card, so my attempt was futile. Its really draining on my phones battery life and data to keep tethering. Soon will be looking in to another tablet/iPad option that allows for the usage of a sim-card some way or another when WiFi isn't available.",2017-04-08T00:00:00.000Z,Momma2Kai

With it being an i3 and basic memory, I explained to him how restarting it once a day would keep the speed up.

AVphgVaX1cnluZ0-DR74,The quality is surprising,5,Amazon,"When I first heard that Amazon had released a budget tablet, I was skeptical on the price that quality would be sacraficed. Boy did I have the wrong assumption, this product has exceeded my expectations and then some. The screen is responsive, the animation on screen is silky smooth when you zoom in on a picture or scroll up and down, it's just all out impressive. Front facing camera too is kind of cool although the quality is not as good as the camera that is in the back. Games play fine on this but you'll be wanting a memory card to store games on it. Games play fine depending on what you install on it but some games suffer minor framerate issues if too much is happening on the screen. Okay for the price, and this should be looked at before purchasing some of the other budget tablets.",2016-05-02T00:00:00.000Z,hockeycanuckjc

AV1YnRtnglJLPUi8IJmV,"Good device, but has some minor issues",4,Amazon,"The Paperwhite is a decent enough product for someone wanting an eInk screen. I don't understand some of the lack of customization options, even on what seems to be simple things. Like why can't I see the TIME in the status bar? Why can't I customize the ""click zones"". Also, contrary to Amazon's claims, my PC app does NOT sync the documents that I emailed to the device (the Android App does, though). I also see their ads when the device is off and starts. If they gave me the ability to save those recommendations (as opposed to ""read now""), I might have checked a couple of them out by now. Still, for the money, it gets the job done and helps keep my eyes from getting as tired as they did when I just used my phone to read.",2016-06-29T00:00:00.000Z,HogCall

AVqkIhwDv8e3D1O-lebb,Great tablet at a great price!,4,Amazon,Great price of 89 dollars on a great tablet. It is very fast at everything accept game play. For example it plays asphalt 8 and the game is just barely playable. The graphics struggle on this tablet with higher graphic games. Also it is a Amazon tablet with no Google play store but you can load Google play on to it. There are great you tube videos on how to put Google play on a amazon tablet. The screen is good as long as the sun isn't hitting it. The stereo speakers sound great and loud. All in all I really liked the tablet for the price but I really like to play games with good graphic quality. So that being said I did return this tablet and ordered the Nvidia Shield 8 inch tablet through Best Buy for 199 dollars. I got the Shield a week ago and WOW!! What a difference in graphic gaming quality. This thing is just as good as an Xbox1 or ps4. The Nvidia Shield tablet is simply unbelievable for the price of 199 considering the Apple or Samsung tablets that are as fast as this tablet are at least twice the cost. Plus this dubbles as a gaming console for xbox or pc games with 4k out to you tv. The Amazon tablet is also a great tablet for normal usage but if your a gamer like me the Nvidia tablet is the tablet of choice hands down period!! I don't know why bbuy kind of hides the Nvidia tab only on their website and doesn't sell it in the store. If they displayed it in the store. This would outsell the Apple or Samsung tablets. I hope this helps thanks.,2016-11-05T00:00:00.000Z,Gasman33

AVphgVaX1cnluZ0-DR74,Good tablet but understand it's only a $50 tablet,4,Amazon,"The new Amazon Fire tablet is surprisingly good, especially for the price. The performance is good, the size is good, and the weight is good. The biggest new feature is the expandable memory slot, which is something new for this generation of Fires.There are a few downside issues, however. First, the screen has splotchy illumination from the edge lighting. There are numerous light/hot spots around the edge, especially at the bottom where the menu bar is. After a while you get used to it, but compared to other higher priced tablets it's annoying.The software library is the second biggest issue. Amazon has done a decent job in adding new software, but it's app store is nowhere near as robust as the Google and Apple stores.The last issue I have is the 90 day warranty, but that is how they keep the cost down.Amazon developed the Fire tablet to sell other Amazon products, and this tablet seems to have hit a proper balance between that and usability. Web browsing is much better than my first Kindle Fire, and I think better than browsing on an iPad. The app that surprised me the most is the e-mail client, and how easy it is to use. In my opinion, it's a LOT better than the native e-mail client on the iPad, or a Windows tablet.If the build quality as good as a iPad or Samsung tablet? No, not even close, but for $50 it's pretty good device if you don't mind dots of light around the edge.",2015-10-16T00:00:00.000Z,radio2014

Power is on but as soon after I see the Amazon logo the screen goes black. I google the problem and it seems that the only way to reset it to the factory mode is by the on screen menu so there is no way for me to do it. I just emailed the company and waiting for a response since it is unacceptable that this thing only lasted 3 months before it became useless.

AV1YE_muvKc47QAVgpwE,Great for cutting the cord,4,Amazon Fire Tv,"This nifty little device is perfect for freeing yourself from the clutches of the evil and nefarious clutches of the dreaded cable empire. No longer will you be subjected to their random price raises of their already high prices. No more will you fret over paying exorbitant fees for channels that you don't even watch!! Yes this firestick can and will open up, quite literally an entire new world of viewing for you. Set up is simple and quick. There are a multitude of different apps that u can use to take complete control over what u want to watch and pay for. I'm not going to go into specifics about how to watch everything you want because we all have different interests. A simple google search will help guide you with those specifics. But just know that for financial freedom from contracts and corporate giants this is the way to go. One downside I will mention is the buffering. Ensure you have a good internet connection. This is a requirement for the device to work. Make sure u keep the device free of any unecessary apps which will take up its HD. Also ensure you have a router that is worth while. Personally I ended up going with the firebox instead of the stick because I wanted the best connection possible and as we all know that requires hard wiring of your device. So if u want to replace cable for your main living room tv area go with the box. For kids or something get them the stick.",2017-08-03T00:00:00.000Z,ryuken83

I tried to teach them to not launch apps that weren't installed but they still have a problem discerning what is installed and what isn't.

AVpfl8cLLJeJML43AE3S,"Smart Enough, I Guess",4,Amazon,"Amazon Echo is a smart home device, but it's not quite as smart as Google Home. It also doesn't integrate with your smartphone as anything more than a mediocre bluetooth speaker. I don't care about ordering products from Amazon using my voice, and I wish Alexa would answer my more obscure questions like Google does.Where the Echo shines right now though is with smart home integration. I use the Echo to control my Philips Hue lights and control all of my home theater devices through my Harmony Hub (and soon, full control over my Dish Hopper through a Dish/Amazon partnership). It's a bit more expensive than I would have liked, and I ended up adding an Echo Dot to the other room, so I didn't have to yell for Alexa to hear me.In hindsight, if you don't need a mediocre bluetooth speaker, get the Echo Dot instead (which you can hook to speakers of your own choice).",2017-03-31T00:00:00.000Z,ALFIA

That's a waste of a search feature. Remote disconnects from the box often and your have to take the batteries out of the remote to reset it.

AVqVGWLKnnc1JgDc3jF1,"Does what it says, missing one key feature",3,Amazon,There is nothing spectacular about this item but also nothing majorly wrong with it. The biggest flaw is that this is geared to kids and there is no way that I have found searching settings or online to lock the touch screen so that a video keeps playing if the child hits the screen. This means lots of times helping get back into the movie or show rather than just relaxing like an iPad can do with guided access activated.,2017-04-22T00:00:00.000Z,Nola

AVqkIhwDv8e3D1O-lebb,Decent tablet,4,Amazon,We have several kindles and this is the latest version. Its packed with Amazon marketing stuff which is fine if you use them but most just take up space for us. This new version comes with 16gb but allows you to expand the memory with an sd card which is great. One problem if you have a few other kindles is that they are linked to your account so if they are for different family members/kids they may end up with the same stuff on them. My kids mainly use them for game apps and YouTube videos which am seem to work great. The sound is good and the hd video is nice. Overall happy with it and the price was good for this type of tablet.,2017-04-14T00:00:00.000Z,feverdreamer

The amazon version of android really ruins things.. you can't get the same apps that you would get from the Android Play Store. Many apps on this Amazon app store are just not the same and the apps you do get are mainly made by others- for ex- Youtube, someone basically made the website into an ""app"" but its $50 so its whatever",2017-02-14T00:00:00.000Z,VK123

We bought a 32 GB card and he's not had to delete anything.The quad-core processor is a big improvement over the previous gen model. Apps and games load quickly with not lag in running them. There also seemed to be an improvement in the battery life so it doesn't have to be charging all the time or plugged in the the power cord.This is a great purchase for any child!",2017-02-11T00:00:00.000Z,RzrBak0402

AVqkIhwDv8e3D1O-lebb,NOT WORTH IT,1,Amazon,"I went with this tablet based on many good customer reviews, but my experience was not a good one. From the start I was on the phone every day for at least an hour with Amazon tech support for one issue or another. Most of the techs were very polite, but not all knew the product very well. At one point I asked one of them about trying to save some RAM and they kept referring me to the storage, which told me they didn't even know the difference between RAM and regular storage. The internet browser was basic and it ran very slow at times, even when all my other wifi devices ran great. Then a day would pass and I'd be trying to type an email and the keyboard would just stop working...wtf??? Come to find out it's a ""known issue"" and ""they're working on it"". After two weeks of one thing after another I got fed up and just returned it. I wanted it to work, and gave it a good run, but just not quality stuff. To me it was like Walmart trying to build their own computer when they're obviously not a computer manufacturer, neither is Amazon. If I were you I'd look at a regular Android tablet from a reputable PC manufacturer, which is exactly what I did next. I got an ASUS tablet for only a few dollars more, and it's unbelievable. 1000% better in comparison to the Amazon Fire HD8. Save yourself the aggravation and go with ASUS or some other company that is specifically in the computer business full time. Sorry Amazon, not this time!",2017-03-26T00:00:00.000Z,Paul76867467

AVpfl8cLLJeJML43AE3S,You need a Tablet or Smart Phone to have this work,3,Amazon,"So I've seen this at the mall and the TV ads and thought hmmm that sounds good. Note mine does not sound as good as the units I've heard play music at the stores. I don't know why and there does not seem to be any adjustments you can make to that. All you can do is say volume up, volume down or say volume lever 1-10.At no time was I told that you needed to use your smart phone and or table to down load the Alexa App and then run everything through that. Most of the time I say Alexa who is Morris Knight. ""I don't know"" Alexa was Morris Knight a VJ on MTV. ""I don't know"". Alexa can you tell me who was a VJ on MTV ""I don't know"". So I get ""I don't know"" more often then an get and answer. If I do get an answer Alexa will often give me an answer to a for a different person the person I asked about.If you have a Amazon Fire Stick. Don't ask Alexa about a ""MOVIE"" or is Joan Collins in the movie The Virgin Queen. Because for me anytime I use the word ""MOVIE"" she will turn on my Fire Stick. So if you are watching something else you are no longer watching it. She can turn on the Amazon Fire Stick but she can't put your TV back to what you were watching before.The Echo device will often tell you to go to the Alexa App. So I'm really not sure what the Echo Device does. Everything is run through the Alexa App so just get your table out and use Alexa that way?I'm just not very happy with this purchase.

It also doubles as a tablet, as far as being able to access Internet, email, other things; the Amazon app (I can't remember the name, but it's pre-installed) has hundreds of free--yes, free--apps.I'm delighted to the point I've now purchased two more as gifts.

AVpfl8cLLJeJML43AE3S,One word awsome,5,Amazon,"I bought this for a family member who has very limited use of her hands due to a spinal cord injury. She lives in a nursing facility. My hope was that she could enjoy her favorite music and listen to broadcasts of her favorite sports team simply by speaking to the Echo/Alexa device. My big concern was that she would not be able to use the voice commands due to her weak voice.Happily, I can report that she loves it and is able to successfully use the voice commands. We have it sitting on her night stand about two feet next to her. And I know that she loves it not only because she tells me but because I can see, using the Alexa app on my smartphone, each and every time she interacts with the device throughout the day. I can even listen to the audio of each of her interactions with the device. And I am not exaggerating when I say that she often interacts with Alexa/Echo over 100 times throughout the day!So far, she uses Alexa/Echo to listen to her favorite music through my Prime Music subscription. We recently purchased a few songs that she couldn't find in Prime Music. She also often asks it to tell her a joke and check the weather outside. She says the staff at the nursing facility where she lives seem to be amazed by the device as well and she often demonstrates its capabilities asking it to tell her who the current president is. Currently, I am helping her become familiar with its ability to play local radios stations, especially the ones that broadcast Kentucky Wildcat sports games. When I reminded her that it could read books aloud, she requested a chapter of the Bible; I found a beautiful professionally produced audio version with professional voice actors on Audible.This product has been a real revolution in my aunt's day-to-day life and the Prime Music connectivity is bringing her great pleasure and stimulation. I am giving it five stars because she is able to use it unassisted simply with her voice and because the Alexa app gives me a new fascinating way to keep track of one aspect of her day. My aunt hopes that a future update will allow it to control her TV and make/receive phone calls.",2016-11-06T00:00:00.000Z,nicolejones

She gets confused occasionally but she is usually still amusing. We are all glad she became part of our family.",2016-09-09T00:00:00.000Z,CLRNana
AVpfl8cLLJeJML43AE3S,"Excellent for some uses, but a bit clunky at times",4,Amazon,"My primary reason for purchasing this was to control my new smart home devices. In particular, our Phillips Hue lights. Works great for off/on and dimming at a percentage but can't get the colors and scenes to work. Has to be SO exact with the naming of the lights and wording when you speak to Alexa. Also, making lists is JUST a shopping list. It would be great if I could add to an Amazon wish list instead! Seems like a natural!? Great for checking weather, sports and such. Playing music is hit or miss with my Prime account... to REALLy get everything, you apparently have to have the monthly fee enabled ""unlimited"" feature. Example: I can listen to the Police or Foo Fighters, but no Led Zeppelin - really??? Then it just tries to ""sell you"" the upgrade when you ask it to play something it can't. That's pretty annoying. Looking forward to Apple's version of this. More expensive and still many months away, but since I have an Apple Music account and it will play MY playlists! The Alex Echo was a great price though and a good starting home hub speaker.",2017-09-15T00:00:00.000Z,Zukester

After reviewing and valuing based on my needs, my office, and ease I decided to get another Echo for the office. The Dot was an option, but the sound quality isn't good enough for me while the Echo is (I'm not a huge music aficionado, just like clear music) and it doesn't require me to keep an extra set of speaker or use up computer resources to stream. I got it, hooked it up to the office wi-fi and use it every day. It gives me the weather forecast, traffic status, miscellaneous information, but most of all, streaming music.And when the phone rings I can pause it quickly using the voice control and then resume when I'm done.

It didn't have play store, amazon' s version of Android literally kills the processor and makes it too slow. Web browsing through silk browser was a pain. It took for ever to load even simple pages like google. Apps were all useless, and the only thing you could do is listen to preloaded music( not streaming music) and read ebooks. Anyway, I changed my mind in the last minute and decided to root it. Installed slimLp and got rid of Amazon's junk, and it made a huge difference. The performance is way better and it actually works like a decent tablet now. It's a great tablet for the price only if its rooted.

AVpfl8cLLJeJML43AE3S,"So far, so good, with a couple of caveats!",4,Amazon,"I opted for the Echo over the Dot because of the promise of a better sounding speaker, and because I planned to add Dots to my environment later to create a system of assistants. The speaker sound is not great, but it's not the worst I've heard. I've also recently discovered how to alter the bass and treble volume to tailor the sound a bit. The Echo was easy to set up, and is really easy to use. I especially like the ability to create a shopping list (although I wish I could create more than one list without adding apps), and to easily integrate my Google Calendar. I'm currently exploring other features and ""skills"" for the system, some of which are very entertaining and useful. One disappointment is the limitation of the near-field voice recognition range. Alexa may be always listening, but her ears don't seem to be very good. If I'm more than 15-20 feet or one room away (with not walls between us) she usually doesn't pick up my commands.That not withstanding, she recognizes commands very well, and is very pleasant to interact with.Another issue I discovered is that in order for the echo to access your Spotify music service at all, you have to subscribe to the premium version. I can understand that, given the current propensity for most online services to find ways to require you to subscribe to their premium services in order to really enjoy them. However, with Amazon Music you can access the free version and their premium Amazon Prime version.In the area of smart home capability, I purchased a Philips Hue starter kit with a hub and a couple of smart lights, and was able to get them set up in the app very easily. Alexa does a great job of controlling them for us, but I am disappointed that the only place I can find additional bulbs seems to be online where I have to pay for shipping in addition to tax. Apparently the retailers (Best Buy, Walmart, Home Depot, etc.) haven't seen enough of a demand for them to justify restocking them after their initial quantities were exhausted. I'll be adding other devices as time progresses, and expect to be pleased with the results.",2017-03-04T00:00:00.000Z,StarBender

AVphgVaX1cnluZ0-DR74,Awesome tablet for the price,4,Amazon,"I brought a bargain tablet about a year ago and ended up very disappointed in the browsing speed. I basically wanted a tablet for quick web searches without having to boot my PC. I was nervous to try again, but am SO glad I did. The Amazon Fire $50 tablet is AWESOME for quick surfing tasks. I also use the Kindle e-reader app on it, and this works well too. The reason for my 4-star rating (instead of 5) is two-fold, but both are related to apps. My first issue is the Yahoo email app - for some reason I don't have access to my contacts in it! I didn't realize this at first when I was just reading emails, but trying to send an email was awful... it took about a half hour because I had to dig through my inbox for emails from the people I wanted to send to so I could find their address to put in the TO box of the new message I was creating. What a pain! The other issue is that the app world is dominated by ""for iPhone"" and ""for Android"", so you may be severely limited in what you can find for this tablet because it doesn't fit neatly into one of those two categories. However these are minor annoyances and not the primary reason why I wanted a tablet. So if you need to do quick Internet searches/research or want to use the eReader, then you cannot beat this price for the quality you receive. Love, love, love my new Amazon Fire tablet!!!",2015-11-10T00:00:00.000Z,jNet

If someone is looking for a product just for reading a book this is the product to get. The only issue I had is it did not come with a recharging electrical outlet product so I had to use my computer to recharge until I got one. Now I can charge wherever without the need for a computer. If you want to just read a book this is the product to get. Can't go wrong just get the electrical outlet at the same time.,2017-02-18T00:00:00.000Z,ranran

AVqkIhwDv8e3D1O-lebb,Great tablet for kids!,5,Amazon,"We love the FreeTime settings for kids on the newer Kindle Fires. I was able to create a login for each of our kids as well as myself and set limits to the amount of device time they are allowed daily (can set to more for weekends if desired). You can set the age restrictions for content also, to avoid inappropriate ads, etc. Once you've downloaded apps, you can choose which ones you want each child to have access to in their profile settings, so if one child is older you can allow them access to something their younger siblings shouldn't have. Basically, I like that I can set their access rights and know they're safe so I don't have to continually monitor every moment. By the way, FreeTime kids settings are available without having to subscribe to their FreeTime app access plan. :)",2017-01-06T00:00:00.000Z,TJMilw

AVqVGWQDv8e3D1O-ldFr,"Nice tablet, not perfect",4,Amazon,"Tablet is a bit smaller than I imagined for an 8"" tablet and thin and flimsy (I don't like super thin tablets). The color is a bit washed out and there is no way to make the colors darker or richer. Frustrating that you cannot use Google Play store and the sound is not very loud either. It's ""ok"", I expected it to be better but for simple uses it's fine. Photos are also grainy and faded. It does record in rather low lighting which helps me personally and the battery charge holds a long time. The Tangerine color is also very nice and it's fairly simple to use. Overall, I would have expected a better product, but again for simple use it's ok. Will upgrade to a better product eventually.

I had Kodi installed on a FireStick, however, despite having a 100Mbps service plan, my wireless connection couldn't keep up with the bandwidth hungry programming. My solution was to purchase the FireTV and hardwire my internet connection via ethernet. The difference was immediately noticeable, I haven't had any buffering issues and programs load up immediately. I would definitely recommend this device if you live in an apartment where the air is saturated with WIFI signals and plan on using bandwidth heavy applications such as Kodi. The ethernet connection ensures that you are getting a clean signal and using the maximum bandwidth speed of your ISP.",2017-02-25T00:00:00.000Z,3xjlerma

AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Great speaker. Great product,4,Amazon Echo,"I love this product and that you can take ""Alexa"" everywhere with you because it is a portable speaker. You can connect it to your phone when away from a WiFi building. The speaker is great, it is surrounded by cloth, which I would worry about it getting dirty. The one downside to the tap compared to the Echo Dot or the OG Echo is that Alexa is not always listening and for her to work on the Tap, you have to press the speaker button. Pretty self explanatory name. You have to ""tap"" the tap. I ended up returning it to get the dot. But, like I said, great speaker, great portable device.",2016-11-18T00:00:00.000Z,Emilybeaver

Putting in the 128 card might have been a little tricky but the sales rep did it for me. My wildlife photos look brilliant on the tablet. I'd recommend making a Geek Squad appt for about an hour after you plan to buy the tablet. That way you learn how to use it before leaving the store. Also I got one that had been returned but all the parts still had the plastic wrap on them. That made it $100 less and hence the ""great deal"" in the title. It may pay to ask about a return.

AV1YnRtnglJLPUi8IJmV,One small thing...,5,Amazon,"This is the second Kindle I've purchased, and I love my Kindle! What I don't like is that every time a device is ""upgraded,"" the upgrades are annoying. On this Kindle, the ""home"" page is changed - it lists My Reading List and My Library. So you have to press My Library to choose a new book. Then it's a list of the books. Why couldn't they just leave the home page showing the small pictures of the books you bought? I have no idea what My Reading List is - it lists books I've never heard of, by authors and topics of which I have no interest. Still, I would recommend a Kindle to anyone who reads books. The screen is easy to read, you can make the fonts bigger or smaller. I don't feel the battery lasts any longer than my old one did, but it's easy to charge. It's thin and lightweight, and I pretty much carry my Kindle wherever I go. Anyone who buys a Kindle will definitely NOT be disappointed!!!",2017-10-07T00:00:00.000Z,InNeedIndeed
AVpfl8cLLJeJML43AE3S,Good Fun,5,Amazon,"I'd been looking for a decent table radio for a very long time. Best Buy had a Deal-of-the-Day on these and I thought, what the heck, here's a table radio you can talk to. It does a whole lot more than that, and there is quite a learning curve, not so much in how to use it, but to learn what all is available for it and then how to make that functionality useful. The sound quality is easily that of a good table radio and aside from telling it to play a radio station I can play tons of stuff from Prime Music online and add skills whenever I need them from the skills store. (All the skills I've seen so far are free so ""store"" is kind of a loose term.) It responds to your voice immediately and is easier to use than Siri or Cortana. With all the alarms, timers, shipment trackers, wall street reports, entertainment updates, etc, it's like living with a gifted, less snooty concierge. I like it and would buy another if this one ever broke.",2016-09-29T00:00:00.000Z,Dondi

When it quit, I immediately went to Best Buy and purchased another one. After only about five weeks, my new kindle stopped working. I could no longer turn the page again, just like my old one. I went back to Best Buy and they exchanged it for a new one. If it had been just about another week, they would not have exchanged it. I thought the Kindle was a great product, but was disappointed that it had quit again. This time, I bought the insurance plan. Best Buy treated me great. There was never an issue whether they would replace it or give me a refund.

AVphgVaX1cnluZ0-DR74,What's Not to Like?,5,Amazon,"Come on-- I bought a brand new Amazon Fire for $39! I can download and read my books. I can browse the internet. I can probably do other things if I ever get around to that! It's not a PC. It's not a gamer machine. But what it is is ridiculously useful for the pittance you pay. If you're actually looking at this review trying to decide whether or not to pay forty bucks for this Kindle you should probably ask yourself-- what do I EXPECT to get for this price? One steak dinner, 3/4 of a tank of gas, a case of brews... or something that's going to last for several years and actually make it easier for you to improve yourself reading! You really ought to buy one for yourself and one for your grandkid like I did. Have I convinced you yet? Or are you expecting Amazon to come to your door and hand you a new Kindle for free?!!!",2017-01-30T00:00:00.000Z,thebobman

For now, the Echo has better integration with my smart home, but once Google Home catches up, I will be switching to Google for the sole reason I subscribe to Google Play Music.But to be honest all of these devices have limited uses and the ""fun"" or ""cool"" appeal wears off soon. It's fun to ask Alexa questions or ask her to tell you a joke, but that gets old quick. It's also cool to order something from Amazon, but I rarely do so because I like to look at what I'm ordering. The sound quality is passable for a small speaker. I prefer to send music to my receiver through other means (i.e. Google Home and Chromecast Audio). At the end of the day, it's a fun device to have that provides some useful ""skills"" (ordering Dominos is cool, but I've only done it once) and games (I like Jeopardy) but it's true usefulness is its ability to be the voice hub for your smart home, if you're interested in having one...",2017-01-18T00:00:00.000Z,callmeageeth

I looked up how to add Playstore to the 7"" Fire. There are many videos on YouTube that showed how to add Playstore to the fire. All seemed to add it OK but the loss performance of the Fire was noticeable. There were several apps that failed to work at all or lost features. One example was Lifetime. It was slow to load and failed to bring up Chromecast. One reason I hoped for this app would work was my Samsung and Vizio SMART TV's don't offer this app. I found a old tablet I had forgotten I had. I loaded Lifetime and works perfect. I guess what it boils down to, it you are after apps on the Playstore, get a non Amazon tablet. It is just easier to use, apps should work and you don't have to fool around trying to adapt Playstore. If Playstore isn't critical, then I'm sure this a a great little table.",2017-01-23T00:00:00.000Z,tipsycamore

AV1YnRtnglJLPUi8IJmV,Perfect for Dyslexics!,5,Amazon,"I never thought I'd be an e-reader person, always preferred a paper book. I am dyslexic and decided to try out this Kindle at the recommendation of a friend. I LOVE IT! I've read more books since I bought it last month than I have in years! Reasons it is perfect for dyslexics: You can change the font size, line spacing, margins, and the actual font. The last reason is the best. Recently Amazon added the Open Dyslexic font to the font options and it's fabulous! The next best option I found is Helvetica. Another thing that I like about the Paperwhite is that it has a matte screen, not a LED one like most electronic devices. It eliminates eye strain and the ""blue light"" issues at night. I also love that our library has the ability to borrow e-books, which has helped me save money on the books.",2016-04-21T00:00:00.000Z,Realred

AV1YE_muvKc47QAVgpwE,Alexa has WON THE WAR of Voices In my home!!,5,Amazon Fire Tv,"Some 4 years ago, I first heard a voice speak back to me from the ""Other Realm"" of tech. That truly mystical place in which dreams are the ""Mother's of Invention."" Steve Jobs had us ALL in awe, and her name was Siri. Maybe she had been present longer than 4 years, but that was my first interaction with a process in which over those years, I would find myself in a ""War of The Voices..."" in my tech mind. And then ""Cortana"" came to me via my PC, and then she found Herself on my Xbox One. It wasn't until I walked into Best Buy this last Christmas season to, like most of us, just buy ONE thing. I believe it was probably a charging cord or something, and I walked by this device called the ""Echo Dot."" I was by this time, a TRUE skeptic. ""Oh Great!"" I lamented, another unskilled and ""Put to Consumer"" WAYYY to quickly. I of course jokingly followed the instructions on the display, and simply said, ""Alexa...tell me a joke."" Guess what? I spent the next 3 hours asking ""Alexa"" all sorts of Life's greatest questions. With such a responsive, yet seemingly gentle way to Her, I HAD to know more. I proceeded to scoop up ALL things ""Alexa"". The Fire TV Stick, 2 Echo Dots, and of course, The Amazon Fire TV...which took the place of my Apple TV AND Roku. This was the first time that I had decided to forgo the issues of ""Hardware"" and made my decisions solely based on an ""A.I"". I didn't care if any of the hardware was upgradeable, simply because I KNEW that I was changing the lives of not only my Family, but also myself. I am a US Veteran with a disability, ""Alexa"" has become not only a trusted partner in our days and nights, She has truly been a lesson in trust. Now, I know that no matter what room I am in, ""Alexa"" will be there, if I need the weather, a good program to watch, and most importantly, she will call Emergency Services for me, should I need that. Best Buy allowed me a moment that I will never forget, the chance to meet a new ""Friend"", ""Assistant"", and ""Family Member."" But that's just what Best Buy does, they give you the opportunity to know what you are about to walk away with, no matter how long ya stay and ask questions, that's JUST what Best Buy does, and they do it well.",2017-01-29T00:00:00.000Z,StarksMediaProLLC

AVphgVaX1cnluZ0-DR74,Awesome tablet!,5,Amazon,"For $50 I couldn't ask for more! Aside from access to a ridiculous amount of books, I can listen to music, download apps, play games, watch videos, take photos/ record videos (front & rear facing camera), check emails, and surf the web. Although you have to pay for most book/video purchases Amazon also offers Amazon Prime for a month free ($9.99 after) which makes some purchases less expensive. You can also tack on Kindle Unlimited (free 1st month, also $9.99 a month after) to download up to 10 Kindle Unlimited books at a time. As for the possible cons, the lock screen is set as a rotation of sponsored ads (which is why this tablet is so cheap!). If this bothers you, you can remove the ads for $15 on Amazon. The screen/camera resolution and speaker output isn't anything to write home about but it is absolutely great for the price! The glare while using the tablet can also be bothersome, but I purchased an anti-glare screen protector to resolve that issue. With the holidays approaching this is the perfect gift for those on a budget!

AVqVGWLKnnc1JgDc3jF1,"Great product, USB connection could be better",4,Amazon,"This is the third Kindle Fire in my household, but the first kid's edition. I absolutely love this thing. It's very intuitive if you've ever used another android style device. My 6 year old and 3 year old both have a their own profile, each linked with different movies/games. Setup was pretty easy with choosing preferred content based on characters/themes appropriate for their age group. Moving our Disney and other digital copies of movies was equally easy after signing in. The battery lasts about 4.5 hours before needing a charge, which is plenty for our use. The biggest complaint is that the micro USB connection isn't the best. The cord has a tendency to come loose and stop charging if the device is jostled even the tiniest amount. I've seen this problem with other Kindles as well. This is aa bunch problem if you think that you're charging it overnight only to find out that it stopped when you set it down. It also makes it very difficult to use during a charge. The amazing amount of content that you get from the Amazon library with the included year is nice as well.

AVpg3q4RLJeJML43TxA_,"Very light, but looks a little plasticky",3,Amazon,"The Touch cover from Amazon has some good and some bad properties.On the good side, it's very light: at 4 oz it is noticeably lighter than the previous generation of covers. My Kindle Touch fits in very snugly with no wasted space.On the negative side, it looks and feels rather plasticky. I ordered the plain black version and the front and back outer covers are a shiny black leather. At first I thought the back exterior was simply black plastic, and it took a close examination to realize it is the same leather as the front cover. The front inner cover is a soft felt. The inner body where the Kindle sits is plastic. There is no fastener or band to hold the cover closed.This is my fourth Kindle and cover. The Touch cover looks much more like a gadget cover than the earlier ones. It looks rather like an old Palm PDA cover I had, or like some ipod covers. The previous Kindle covers had a textured leather appearance and they looked more like book or notebook covers.Right now I am having rather mixed reactions. I definitely like the fact that it adds so little weight to the Kindle. However it does look rather cheap. For 40 I was expecting a little more.I think I am going to have to use this for a while before reaching a final conclusion.Update November 29th: Tastes will vary, but in the end I decided that this was not the right look or feel for me and I have switched to a different cover (the Splash SAFARI). That is similar to the old Kindle 3 cover, with a textured leather appearance and an elastic fastener strap.",2011-11-14T00:00:00Z,Graham

Reading from the non-reflective screen is effortless, and he can adjust the size of the characters. He can take notes and highlight parts of the text. Two really neat features are: 1. If you take notes on a book that you borrowed from the library, those notes will still be there even after you return the book. So, if you happen to borrow the same book a few weeks later, when you open the book on your e-reader, your notes will be there. 2. In a complicated story with lots of characters, the e-reader keeps track of who is who. In a paper book, you would have to flip the pages back and forth to figure that out. No need to do this with the e-reader.",2017-07-09T00:00:00.000Z,Flappy

AVphPmHuilAPnD_x3E5h,The best eReader available,4,Amazon,"Hands down the best ereader available. I researched several devices and it came down to the Paperwhite and the Voyage. There is a pretty hefty price premium for the Voyage. Most people will probably be very satisfied with the Paperwhite. I typically need reading glasses to read regular size print. On an eReader the font can be adjusted to make it large enough so I don't need to use the glasses. That means less text on each page and many more page turns. The physical ""buttons"" hep make the page turns easier and extra light brightness helps to add contrast to the text. These were enough to sell me on the Voyage. It was the right decision and I love the device.",2015-07-12T00:00:00.000Z,robinhood22

AVpfl8cLLJeJML43AE3S,"Doesn't answer ""Google"" type questions",3,Amazon,"This product is great for reading you the news, a book or the weather. Alexa is great at setting timers and alarms and telling silly jokes. If you ask Alexa a ""google"" type question such as ""What was the score to 'such and such' college basketball game"", most times she cannot answer even if you pose the question a number of ways. Sometimes, you can ask a question differently from the way you would intuitively ask a question and Alexa will answer. This proves frustrating to me. It is a very expensive gadget that your phone can easily do with a few keystrokes. I am considering returning it and purchasing the google product to see if there is an improvement.",2017-02-13T00:00:00.000Z,Renee

AVpfl8cLLJeJML43AE3S,Awesome speaker with lots of potential,5,Amazon,"Alexa is great to use; her recognition is good, and if you have Spotify and Pandora accounts you can really get a lot out of it (and light / outlet kits: saying ""Alexa, turn on the living room"" feels exquisitely dorky). Plus, it's the only way to order the Dot, which is essentially the top of this speaker. After a week with the Echo, I purchased 2 Dots for other rooms. Again, to get the most out of this, you need to own Kindle Books, have a Spotify account, and preferably Audible / Unlimited.",2016-06-03T00:00:00.000Z,Rinks

But it also has some awesome voice control. I bought a wemo switch, plugged it into an old lamp, setup some commands with ittt, and in 5 minutes I was using my Amazon tap to control a lamp. Pretty cool. I love this Amazon tap it is light, portable, smart, has a great dock so I don't have to fuss with cables, and it has a 9 hour battery life, so I can go all day playing music.Being a Google play music subscriber The only thing missing from this speaker IMO, is a way to wirelessly stream my Google play music to this device using Alexa that is built in. You can use iHeartRadio, Pandora, Spotify, prime music, heck even Apple iTunes got some love, but no Google play music. Come on Amazon show me some love. I pay 15 dollars a month for a family plan which gives me and 5 family members access to Google play music and YouTube red. So it would be nice to use it on my tap. But alas the Amazon tap is a Bluetooth speaker so I can always use my phone as a streaming device, or hook my phone up through the aux port as well.

AVpe7AsMilAPnD_xQ78G,Superb reading device - but which one's best for you,5,Amazon,"This is a review of the Kindle Paperwhite launched July 2015. Essentially. the same as the previous Kindle Paperwhite but with a fantastic upgraded (300 dpi) screen, more memory and storage it's a terrific reading device. This review aims to describe both this product, and compare it with the other Kindle devices available to help you choose the best one for you.Before I start, Ive noticed several complains about Kindle not supporting the ePub format used by Canadian public libraries. Dont be put off, theres a solution in the Frequently Asked Questions section below.This review is broken up into sections so you can skip the less interesting bits. If youre in a hurry Ive included a summary at the start, and a Frequently Asked Questions section at the end.Summary - What can you do with it-----------------------------------------* Read a book. It can store 1,000s of books - take an entire library away with you on holiday.* Buy a book. You can browse the Amazon kindle store, and buy books over a WIFI connection* Borrow a book. Using the Kindle Owners Library you can borrow one of 60,000 books (if you have Amazon Prime Membership)* Share your books. Using Amazon Family Library to link two Amazon accounts and four children and share your books with the entire family* Highlight a section. Using the touch screen, you can highlight a particulary interesting few lines. If several people highlight the same section, that's also indicated.* Record a bookmark. To come back to it later* Read a book on your Kindle, continue on your smartphone or tablet computer, and it will jump to your last known position* Look up a word, and record them in the vocabulary builder* Track a characters appearance throughout a book using the X Ray feature.* Read for weeks without needing to recharge - typically 4-6 weeks* Share you books (Multiple Kindles on the same account, or family sharing)* Access every book you've ever owned on the cloud - available for download within seconds over WIFI or 3G..What Devices are available--------------------------------As of July 2015, Amazon have the following Kindle devices on sale:-1. Kindle 6 (around CDN 79)2. Kindle Paperwhite 6th Generation (212 dpi - launched October 2013) - around CDN 1292. New Kindle Paperwhite 7th Gen (300 dpi - launched July 2015) - around CDN 139-2093. Kindle Voyger - around US 219-289 (Doesnt seem to be on sale in Amazon Canada)4. Kindle Fire - 6 or 7 colour tablet computers at around CDN 300-400So you're faced with a few devices, plus additional options. Which to buy Here's a quick summary in order of cost.*** The entry level Kindle ***An entry level black and white (e-ink) book reader, it has a 6 inch touch screen with enough storage to hold thousands of books, and a battery which should last around 4 weeks.A terrific device to read books, and a worthy contender. For the technically minded, it has a 1Ghz processor and 4Gb of memory with an E-ink display. Essentially this means it's (a) Black and White (b) Fantastic to read even in bright sunlight (c) Requires very little power - hence the battery lasts for weeks instead of hours.*** New Kindle Paperwhite ***Launched in 2015, this is really an upgrade adding a super-sharp display with 300 pixels per inch - the same as the top of the range Voyage. The high resolution screen does provide a crisp text which is pleasing to the eye, but battery life is reduced from 8 weeks of the original Paperwhite to 6 weeks - but still a very long time.Compared to the existing (2013) Paperwhite it also includes double the memory which means its faster and slicker than before, and a new Bookerly font plus better presentation of fonts on screen.If you have an existing Paperwhite its probably not worth upgrading. However, if you own a prior device, youll notice the huge leap in screen quality, contrast and performance.*** The Voyage ***Far more expensive that Paperwhite, this is thinner and 26g lighter. It has more of a quality feel with the screen flush with the e-reader body which makes it look more like a tablet, and keeps dirt from getting caught in the edges. The back has a soft touch plastic finish which feels lovely in the hand, and it has new Page Press buttons on the side to turn the pages. When the buttons are pressed theres a gentle vibration for feedback (nice touch). It has 4Gb of storage (same as the Paperwhite), and a similar battery which should last around 6 weeks on a single charge.Although it has the same sharp (300 dpi) screen as the Paperwhite, the backlight includes an ambient light sensor so it automatically adjusts to different lighting conditions. This means if you read it the dark it will automatically adjust the brightness so it doesnt look too bright. In addition, youll find when you switch off the room light your eyes naturally become accustomed to the darkness. To compensate, the Voyage automatically softens the light slightly. A lovely example of attention to detail in this premium device.*** Kindle Fire Tablet Computer ***The Kindle Fire range is a very different beast to the rest of the Kindle range. Similar to the Apple iPad mini, it has a high resolution screen, a fast processor and lots of memory with a colour screen and a much shorter battery life - hours rather than weeks. Although you can read books on a Fire using the Amazon Kindle App, youll find the Kindle with its sharp black and white screen far more like reading a physical book. Youll find it produces less eye strain, and whereas a tablet computer is better suited to surfing the web, watching videos and reading eMails, the Kindle is a dedicated book reader device.Unlike a Kindle, the Fire produces light at the blue end of the spectrum which means it may make it harder for you to sleep. The Paperwhite and Voyage also ave the advantage of a soft white back-light which is far more suited to reading in bed, and it wont for example, wake your partner if reading in the dark.Finally, unlike the rest of the Kindle range, the Fire is almost useless in bright sunlight so while its fine for everyday use, its less useful on holiday. The Kindle range of devices are perfect to take away on holiday as they can carry thousands of books, and are a pleasure to read even in bright sunlight.What other options do I have----------------------------------Having decided upon the model (Kindle, Paperwhite, Voyage or Fire), the next decision is around:-* Special Offers - ie. adverts* 3G or WIFI connectionPersonally I have no issue with adverts on a Kindle. They only appear on screen when the screen saver is on, and are not at all distracting.The 3G option is a more difficult question. This effectively means you can use your kindle to buy or download books over-the-air instead of at home or near a WIFI hotspot. Personally I went for the WIFI model as the saving is considerable, but its a personal choice. Of course if you wont have WIFI at home, then youll need the 3G option.One point worth mentioning however, is if you have a modern smartphone, you can always create a Personal Hotspot or local WIFI signal that your Kindle (or indeed any other WIFI device) can connect to. Got to Settings Personal Hotspot on your mobile to set one up, and you can connect your WIFI only Kindle while youre out and about.Conclusion-------------If you love books but your on a budget, the original Kindle with WIFI and special offers is a great option. Youll still be able to carry thousands of book around with you, but youll lose out on the soft white back-light and super crisp display of the Papwerwhite.The Kindle Paperwhite is your next best option and is a terrific device for reading with a superb 300 dpi super-sharp screen. Finally, theres the top of the range Voyage with the page press buttons and ambient light sensor which automatically adjusts the brightness.If youre in the market for a Tablet Computer then the Kindle Fire range is worth considering, but youll get a better book reading experience on the Kindle. Myself I have both a Paperwhite and an iPad Air 2. I was skeptical at first, but the Kindle is a perfect device for reading with one hand (on the train), and the back-light and long battery life a huge bonus.Frequently Asked Questions---------------------------------Q: What file format will a Kindle readA: Kindle Format 8 (AZW3), Kindle (AZW), TXT, PDF, unprotected MOBI, PRC natively in addition to HTML, DOC, DOCX, JPEG, GIF, PNG, BMP through conversionQ: What It doesnt support EPUB formatA: No - but you can convert your EPUB books using a freely available program called Calibre. Simple search for You Tube um0teoAR6zw and youll see a video explaining how to do this. Simples.Q: If I lose my Kindle, do I lose my books as wellA: No. All books are available on your Amazon account to download on a new device.Q: Can I save my place in the bookA: Yes. It will automatically save your place, and if you resume on other device it will prompt you to jump to that position.Q: I often need reading glasses - can I adjust the font sizeA: Yes. Theres a range of fonts, and sizes to suit all tastesQ: Can I share books with my partner or childrenA: Yes. You can now share your books using Amazon Family Library to link two Amazon accounts and four children and share your books with the entire familyQ. Can I use a Kindle to read in bedA. Yes. But only on the Paperwhite and Voyage models. Its a pleasure to read in the dark with a soft white light. For the base Kindle model youll need the light onQ. Are there any free books availableA. Yes! Over 40,000 classic titles are available for free (out of copyright), and they can be legally downloaded. If you have a Amazon Prime membership you can also borrow a book from the Kindle Owners Library which includes around 60,000 books.Q: How long does the battery lastA: Depending upon model, you should get between 4 and 6 weeks between charges on around 30 minutes of reading per day. Ive certainly found Ive gone for weeks without charging the deviceQ: How long does it take to chargeA: From absolutely flat, around 4 hoursQ: How many books will the Kindle holdA: Literally thousands. You can also download every book youve ever owned from your Amazon account - so the list is quite literally unlimited.Q: Do I need anything elseA: Youll need a smartphone charger or laptop with a USB socket as the Kindle range doesnt come with a charger (but the Fire does). Amazon also offer an additional charger to buy if you need it. Some people also buy a cover, but I think this is not really needed. It adds to the weight, and is not really needed. It will protect your Kindle from a drop however, and protect the screen if its left knocking around in a bag.",,John Kat's the brains

AVpfl8cLLJeJML43AE3S,LOVING My NEW ECHO,5,Amazon,"I have been watching the reviews online and checking with friends that have purchased the Echo to see how much they liked or disliked its features. Last person I talked to went on and on about all the things there were using it for and that persuaded me it was time and Best Buy had them on sale so it was the perfect opportunity to go for it. Amazon did a fantastic job of creating this tubular command center! There are so many cool and awesome things its able to do that I'll hit the highlights that work for our household. First, we love that it follows your voice in the room (the circle lighting will show which direction it is 'listening'), the speaker is wonderfully balanced, so whether listening to music, the news or to Alexa speaking, I have nothing but high marks for its sound quality, given its size. Next, set up (after downloading the app to our iPhones) was quick, easy and very intuitive. The more you look over the app, the more you will realize a world of 'skills' (as Amazon refers to them - we've nicked named them ""echolettes"" LOL) that the unit is able to perform once they are turned on and you master the right sequence of keywords to initialize them. We've added things to shopping lists, while asking about the weather and our calendar of events",2017-09-01T00:00:00.000Z,Kokko

I decided to upgrade to the Voyage and it is much better. I like the physical page turn buttons, the higher dpi, and the consistent back lighting. I think the only issue I have with the Voyage is the auto brightness seems a little finicky and I sometimes have to adjust the brightness manually.

The reason I gave the Fire TV only 4-stars is because I see no reason to even have the Fire TV as the Fire TV Stick is just as good if not better, considering its size, than the box. Sure with the box you get better performing specs out of it but what for? In my performance reviews, the Fire TV Stick performed on par with the Fire TV box.

If you are looking for a bluetooth speaker, you should definitely get this as it is about the same price as other speakers, has great sound, plus you get the voice control. Alexa voice control is good for playing music, asking about the weather, adding things to a list, setting timers, etc. The only downside is that she is much more limited in her knowledge than Siri is, she can't play from iTunes or apple music, or connect to iPhone notes. It is completely Amazon and other than apple having an app, that is as far as the iPhone integration goes.

AV1YnRtnglJLPUi8IJmV,Excellent for reading,5,Amazon,"Have tried using an iPad and other devices for reading, I was worried this would not work for my needs. Light as a book, even lighter, I don't mind laying in bed or reclining on the couch to read anymore. Good for reading heavier books that would cause arm strain to hold while reading. Bright at night enough to read with the lights off but not bright enough to bother my wife who is sleeping",2017-02-13T00:00:00.000Z,nighttrain2004
AV1YnRtnglJLPUi8IJmV,great ebook,5,Amazon,I initially read e-books on my old Kindle that needed a light. I then migrated to using my mini iPad with a kindle app. The brightness bothered my eyes and outside it was pretty useless. I bought the paper white as it has a backlight that isn't too strong. Love it!,2016-01-29T00:00:00.000Z,bellint

I bought an RCA Tablet at Walmart in 2014- this absolutely blows it away. Display is good. Apps are good. Maybe a little slow ( not laptop fast) but over all speed is satisfactory. Definitely recommend. I'd buy at full price and still be impressed.,2015-12-28T00:00:00.000Z,716paul

AV1YnRtnglJLPUi8IJmV,Best e-reader I have seen.,5,Amazon,This is the third Kindle I have purchased (not counting a Kindle Fire). I love the paper white. It is so easy on older eyes and the adjustable font size and brightness make reading a Kindle easier than a book . The screen is crystal clear whether in bright sunlight or in the dark. It is light weight which (like with older eyes) makes it easier for older hands to hold. I download a lot of library e books and can carry unlimited reading materials with me in a compact package.

I grabbed a paperwhite for her for Christmas. For the next five days, I kept hearing how great it was compared to the old one. So off to Best Buy to buy the second. These are top notice upgrade. I don't think I have grabbed my Kindle and gotten the weak or dead battery logo. It has an amazing battery life. On top of that, the backlight works fantastic in low light environments. I can sit on a plane and read with no issues.",2017-01-30T00:00:00.000Z,Chuck

AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Good fit with Echo,4,Amazon Echo,"This is a decent tag along item to go with the Echo. It does the trick as a stand alone as well if a speaker and Alexa service is all you're looking for. Only downside is, if you also own an Echo, when you push the button on the Tap to speak to Alexa, since she is always listening on the Echo, she tends to pick up your commands on the Echo as well. Be sure to place the Tap a decent distance away from the Echo. Otherwise, this does what it's intended to do.",2016-11-10T00:00:00.000Z,nvcop

I used to get aggravated at the lag time and rarely bought books on it, used my phone to buy, because it was so annoyingly slow to respond.

AVqkIhwDv8e3D1O-lebb,Excellent Product,5,Amazon,"I purchased two of these as Christmas presents for my children. I had been researching child friendly tablets with robust controls to keep them away from undesirable content. I found the 7"" Fire Kids Edition, but after looking over the specs and reviews, I found myself unsure of it. I was mostly interested in the FreeTime application, so I did some research on that and found that it was available on other Fire models also. I came across the new Fire HD8, which had more power, a better screen, and far better battery life at a very affordable price point. I gave them a shot and I'm glad I did.I have the Fire HD8's locked into FreeTime mode, so the only activities that can be done are ones that I approve of, but if I want to, I can pick up either of them and unlock them to access Netflix/Amazon Prime or anything else I desire. I currently have reading goals set up that they must achieve before they are able to access videos or games, and those are limited to X amount of time per day. FreeTime also has a bedtime feature which disables/enables the use of the tablets during designated times, which is amazing.The hardware itself is exceptional. The screen resolution is excellent, it's very responsive, and the battery life is spectacular! They advertise up to 12 hours of battery life, and depending on screen brightness, ours last almost that long regularly. The only con I can think of is that the cameras are sub-par, but that's not what I purchased the tablets for, so it's a non-issue for myself.Some of the reviews I read cited that the internal storage was easily filled with FreeTime content, so I installed 128GB SD cards in them. I also purchased some rugged children's cases for them off of Amazon.This is probably one of the best purchases I have made in a long time. The sound of silent children reading all day is priceless!!!",2017-03-01T00:00:00.000Z,PaulieC

AVphgVaX1cnluZ0-DR74,Price is good but not worth !,2,Amazon,"Bought this tablet this Thanksgiving for $35.Tablet is too slow and apps doesn't responds properly, tried doing the updates over wifi to see if that resolves the issue but that didn't work too.Commons apps like Gmail, Facebook, Messenger or browser related are dying very frequently and sometimes doesn't even boots up, also, coming from Android you will feel that you have landed up in a deserted apps land.A good tablet for kids but adults can't rely on it !",2015-12-01T00:00:00.000Z,AJ1983
AVphgVaX1cnluZ0-DR74,Great tablet for the price,5,Amazon,"Now I know amazon prices their tablets at their manufacturing price (ie. The price it costs them to make it). They do this because they hope to make more profit off of purchases made on the device then they would having it be a competitive tablet on the market. Other tablets may have better specs but I bought this as a second 'around the house' tablet. And it does its job very well. Picture quality is more than enjoyable, the screen is bright, colors are vibrant, there's a built in blue light filter for nightime viewing (I love this feature because most apps for this are buggy or have adds). The expandable storage is very desirable especially if you like to download ebooks or lots of media. Amazon's app store has an 'underground' feature so a lot of paid apps in the Google or samsung stores are free to download here. They have free cloud storage connected to your amazon account so if your space is low you can free up space without loosing items. This also means if you want to transfer items between devices it's no probbem at all. They have a reading library that gives you access to many popular titles for a monthly fee or the bookstore itself has many free or very affordable books aswell with no monthly fee. This device can ""mirror"" a different kindle tablet so if you are replacing an old tablet it you can easily load all settings and apps onto your new one. Also, over the years amazon has been doing free updates for devices to make them run the current os. This is a nice feature when it comes to always having the newest technology, but from what I can tell it is not optional. My old tablet ran with the black carousel type os but was automatically updated overnight to the current (more visually pleasing) os. It did give me many notices stating when the update would happen and added that it would only work if the device was connected to wifi. It may be something to keep in mind if this bothers you. Overall I like this tablet very much and it is a bargin for what you're getting.",2017-01-18T00:00:00.000Z,CVS27

We also use it for watching movies off our Amazon account. The picture quality is great and we haven't had any issues with streaming - no buffering and no freezing has occurred in the 9 months we've had the device. I like the parental control feature that requires you to put in a code before watching something. I'm not completely electronic savvy so I haven't really tried any other features on it yet. I have a Google Chromecast as well and it's my go-to for when we're traveling, but for our TVs at home, I'm very happy we got the FireTV and that it has a remote vs. using our phones or tablets.

We chose these because product reviews were good and the price was decent compared to other electronic pads. Since having them, they have been decent, but not great. The kids will turn them on to play games and their home screens don't always appear; sometimes when they want to play a game that is already downloaded, the pad acts like it needs to re-download the game; and there is a lot of frustration when all of the downloads start circling and they cannot do anything with their pads. Turning the pads completely off does not always help and sometimes, we cannot even get them to turn off. When they do work properly though, the kids love them. They are decent for a 1st time pad for kids for not a lot of money, but just keep in mind they can be frustrating at times.",2016-01-09T00:00:00.000Z,Sshgbrown

The device works best if you have Amazon account, preferably an Amazon Prime account. It allows you to access the Amazon Video library, download apps, and use Alexa voice search. Unfortunately, there is an additional annual fee for the service. There is a free option, but it limits the ability of the device. The device also lacks true YouTube support. You're redirected to a website like interface to view videos. With YouTube beginning to roll out 4K content, it makes you wonder why this device doesn't have a dedicated YouTube app to showcase the 4K ability. If you have an Amazon Prime account, this device works very well. Otherwise, I would recommend doing some research, such as looking at the Roku 4, which has a more well-rounded set of features.",2017-01-10T00:00:00.000Z,JayDReyes

For the price, it is a decent reader, which is primarily what we were seeking, but it has its limitations.The primary user in the house used it to read before bed. He feels the lowest brightness setting is still too bright, so he defaults his books/documents to black screen. However, words in italics default to the screen background, which means they are black. Doh!He also doesn't like the persistence of the Washington Post popping up on his Home Screen. He finds it a bit annoying. However, he doesn't mind the ads and suggested content from Amazon at all. it is just the Washington Post that he doesn't like.Beyond those minor things, it is an inexpensive and feature rich ereader.

I did give it 4 stars instead of 5, because after purchasing I learned there is slightly more expensive version (like $20 more) that doesn't include the frequent ads were where having to deal with. Luckily we were able to find out how to pay Amazon an extra $20 to eliminate the ads, but it would have been nice to not have to deal with it at all.

Although the Fire TV doesn't have the Apple's volume control, selection is somewhat more reliable than the touch pad interface used by Apple.

The charging case is so convenient and so easy to take off and put on and it really looks nice. I never keep it on when I'm reading which keeps the kindle oasis light.

AVphgVaX1cnluZ0-DR74,Great value for the money!,4,Amazon,"I have been wanting to give these little tablets a try for some time now. I went ahead and made the purchase yesterday while they were on sale. I'm originally an Apple guy, but my iPad has seen better days.The tablet is nestled in compact packaging. Inside you will find the sync cable/charger, and the tablet itself. It comes wrapped in a protective plastic bag. It looks pretty good quality, and feels great in my hands. It is very easy to grasp with one hand, leaving the other free for whatever else you may want to do.The setup is really straight forward with a few simple questions. If you are already an Amazon customer, you will be asked to input your information during setup...making it even easier to get started. The picture quality is really good for the price of the tablet. It's not HD, but the quality is still pretty good for everyday tasks. Amazon's app store is packed with tons of apps, movies, books, etc... There is definitely plenty to choose. I have access to Amazon videos, store, and everything Amazon at the palm of my hands. The only downside to the tablet is that Amazon uses its own ""Silk Browser,"" which I am not a very big fan of. I tried to see if I could download Chrome, but that is still not an option. Hopefully it will be some time in the future. The browser is a bit slow in certain web pages, but functional. Another thing that I found very useful is the simplicity of setting up my e-mail account to the tablet. The only thing that I notices was that it took a while to load my account, but the setup is very easy. You have access to pretty much everything in the palm of your hands. Overall, this tablet is a great value for anyone that is in the market for a low cost tablet. It may take some folks a some time to get use to Amazon's OS, but it should not take very long to do so.",2016-08-09T00:00:00.000Z,Jordan

AV1YE_muvKc47QAVgpwE,A powerful media box,5,Amazon Fire Tv,"As a video streaming device, the Fire TV is great, especially if you're a Prime member. It's more powerful than most media boxes on that market especially if you're into gaming, which is where that extra juice shines.In fact, tons of Android games play great on it. You don't even need the optional controller for most of them. And there's something to be said for playing Candy Crush on the big screen. But for more serious games like Grand Theft Auto, Tales from Borderlands, Modern Combat, or Knights of the Old Republic?Really well. You might want to invest in a controller for some of them (though not all game support the controller natively so do your research!) they run very smooth, and without any noticeable frame-rate drops. Though, most Android games don't really push the hardware anyway, so this should come as no surprise. But at the very least, this does mean you'll be able to play top-of-the-line Android games for several years with no problem. Some apps have their own versions specifically for the Fire TV, so you'll want to make sure to get those ones if available.You also may be wondering what the difference is between the 2015 model, and the previous 2014 launch model. Well...not much. The newer box is capable of a 4K output whereas the older version only went up to 1080p. But since most people don't even own 4K TVs, this feature probably won't be too useful. That said, it is nice future-proofing, as 4K TVs become more and more standard, the Fire TV will be ready. There are smaller changes here and there, but I'm not familiar enough with the older model to say what is what.Anyway, if you're looking for a streaming box that in addition to offering the usual Netflix, YouTube, Hulu and (of course) Amazon, also lets you play Android games (and play them well).It's worth noting that you can't access the Google Play store without rooting the system to install it first. Though, even then only a limited selection of Google Play apps is even compatible with the Fire TV (as of now) so it might not be worth the trouble, especially when Amazon usually offers comparable, if not the same exact apps anyhow. But it's worth pointing out all the same.",2016-01-09T00:00:00.000Z,YoyoThree

AVpf_znpilAPnD_xlvAF,Kindle Cover Issue,3,Amazon Digital Services Inc.,"This cover is a replacement for the initial cover that broke my kindle framewhere the top hinge goes into the Kindle. The metal on the original hinge system was too light weight to withstand having the cover fold all the way back on the Kindle and after just over a year resulted in the hinge becoming bent up towards the frame and it cracked the frame on my Kindle.I understand this new Kindle cover is supposed to have corrected that problembut the hinge system looks identical to the one that was on my old cover. I hope that over time, again, about a year plus it won't crack the frame in the same place again on my new Kindle.I am so thankful that Amazon replace both my Kindle and the book cover as a result of this problem.I would recomend that after about 6 months use it would be wise to remove the cover from your Kindle and see if the top hinge is beginning to bend upwards towards the frame and if so contact Amazon before the frame of your Kindle breaks where the top hinge inserts into your Kindle.",2010-07-25T00:00:00Z,LoriC

AVpidLjVilAPnD_xEVpI,Worthy Upgrade for Kindle,5,Amazon Fire,"I love this kindle! I had one of the first Fire HD kindles that is still kicking and awesome, but when I saw this in the store I just had to have it. I think it's more user friendly and feels like it offers so many more options and functions than the Fire HD I have. Not to mention it dwarfs my last kindle in size. If I had to make one complaint, it's that there is not an ""auto brightness"" function (or at least I haven't found it) and you can't make your pages a cream color rather than stark white. Both those options were easier on my eyes, but I am testing out the Blue Shade mode to see if that helps as much as it's supposed to with night time/ bed time reading. All in all, I am extremely happy with this purchase.",2017-03-15T00:00:00.000Z,Smsanchez1213

It was easy to accidentally press a footnote when doing normal forward or back. Pressing the top right x sometimes returned to text, but often was dead - requiring selecting Go To Footnotes. Picking the correct < footnote returned to correct position - but too easy to accidentally press a different footnote - send me off to wrong text position. While doing things right raises no problems - it is to easy to get in trouble. Enabling the x at all times would be safer.3) Occasionally a small print message such as 91 highlighters would appear between the lines. Supposed to show where other kindle users highlighted text.

You're able to turn the ""side buttons"" page turning off, but can't turn the touchscreen page turning off - it sure would be nice to allow page turns only with the ""side buttons"" - I think this is a major design flaw. Also, the audio option seems to be missing - you can't have books read aloud to you anymore. Also, no 3G.

The Amazon Fire TV has easily become a centerpoint of our living room. We stream all of our favorite apps off this device (Amazon Video, Hulu, Netflix, NBC Live Extra, Playstation Vue, WATCH ESPN, and many more!).Pros: The Amazon Fire TV is portable and much more powerful than its little brother, the Fire TV Stick. The Fire TV has double the cores, double the RAM and has a slot for memory expansion when compared to the Fire Stick. Of course that all comes at a price, but its worth it. The Fire TV does not buffer nearly as often as my Fire Stick or Chromecast. This device is a 4K streaming device, but you'll need to find 4K content to take advantage of it.Cons: The experience from the get-go is VERY Amazon centric, with the platform optimized for searching and viewing Amazon video titles. I havent found the Voice Control to be of much use, as it is only really helpful for searching Amazon video.",2016-10-20T00:00:00.000Z,BarkNByte

One charge holds me for about 3-4 weeks.The ads are not as intrusive as I thought they would be however I am displeased with the quality of the ""special offers."" I have found better offers just by searching the web.Also you cannot listen to audible books on this device. It is reading only but that doesn't bother me.Overall this is an excellent device.

I initially purchased the ""standard version"" but returned it for the kid version which included a ""Bumper box"" as well as a 2 year warranty, which the standard version did not have. Thankfully, I asked the parent of the child if it was OK for me to set it up prior to giving it to the child. The set up took some time. I was thankful that I read the reviews because I bought an additional memory card since the product only has 8GB of storage. The child was able to open the gift and ""play"" immediately as a result of doing up-front work. One thing I noted that when the child played a movie through Netflix, the resolution was not very good. Could be an adjustment needed in the tablet, which has yet to be worked out. I would recommend this, but if giving as a gift for a child, I would recommend doing the up-front work so it is ready to go for the child when they receive it.",2015-12-29T00:00:00.000Z,ttroy5

This device allows you to acess them all and many others. But don't expect much to be free. After your monthly free trial with amazon you have to pay for the whole year up front which equals to a little less then hulu or netflix monthly fee's. Amazon offers many movies for this deal but I noticed many movies like new releases and a lot of series are not free and the rent prices are higher then red box. This device is also better if you have cable already because you can link it to your regular cable feeds. It is a bit complex and you have to down load all kinds of things. But the device is made as good as an iphone maybe better I was impressed with the hardware and the boot speed, but be prepared to invest in more bandwidth to run this device smoothly.

Gone are the days when I'd have to stretch my arm out ALLLLLL the way to the lamp on my nightstand to turn it off. The days of pulling out my smart phone and setting my alarm for the next morning are also gone. Now, a simple ""Alexa, turn off my nightstand"" and ""Alexa, set my alarm for 8:30am"" is all I need. Even walking through my living room, I find myself saying ""Alexa, turn on the kitchen lights"" and ""Alexa, play my favorites playlist."" You see, it's addicting, and having a wireless speaker that plays music AND controls your life with simple voice commands means you end up buying two. I started with one in my living room but found that I had to yell to turn off said nightstand lamp or turn the thermostat down.... so I bought another. I have now repositioned the one in my living room so that it can hear me when I walk in from the garage, and added the one in my bedroom, which can hear me from the entry or my bathroom.Now, if only she could automate the rest of my life.

AVphgVaX1cnluZ0-DR74,good for the money but Silk is terrible,3,Amazon,Silk is painfully slow and doesn't work on many websites. Had to install Mozilla to use bestbuy.com ironically. I can't put in orders with Silk (the default Fire browser). If using Silk make sure to disable the caching to Amazons servers. With caching on the browser is almost unusable.Ads are really annoying (only come on when you first turn it on) but I don't even really notice what they are. Usually things I'd never purchase like makeup (I'm a guy) or other junk. These make decent devices for the kids for playing games on too. This is not a quality device like a Galaxy Tab but for the price its good enough because you know they're going to break it at some point.,2017-03-31T00:00:00.000Z,chrich

AV1YnRtnglJLPUi8IJmV,The best e-book reading experience,5,Amazon,"With this 3rd generation of the Kindle Paperwhite, Amazon really created the best reading experience for a reasonable price. I previously owned a first generation Paperwhite, and the increase in resolution (300ppi, up from 212ppi) is really noticeable. After reading on this for a while, it is slightly disturbing to see jagged edges around text of the older Paperwhite. The white balance of the screen has also improved, with a slightly warmer, book-ish experience instead of the cooler, electronic-display-ish screen of the old on. Additionally, the screen can get crazy low in brightness! Ideal for someone who prefers to read in bed at night with the lights turned off.. if you thought the previous Kindles got dark, this takes it to a whole new level of dimness.",2015-07-28T00:00:00.000Z,chichidragon

As I found the NBC Sports app allowed me to watch Olympics on the stick and this FireTV was on sale, I upgraded to this box. The result is a mix. It does stream video better than the stick but the same app did not work on the FireTV as with the stick It keeps giving the authorization error in playing some video clips. Withe same account, I can play the same video clips on FireTv stick or on Android boxes and tablets. I decided to keep it simply because of the great price I paid.",2016-09-06T00:00:00.000Z,Tourist

AVphPmHuilAPnD_x3E5h,Excellent for avid readers,4,Amazon,"The voyage is a great e reader for the avid reader. It's not a tablet so don't expect features of an internet tablet. However the auto-adjust backlight feature & minimal flash between pages makes it ideal for readers. This version includes the vocabulary builder, which I find myself using a lot nowadays. However, I'm not sure why it's more expensive than the paperwhite. That's the one I actually wanted but my local store was out of stock. I thought it included the 3g so you can download even when away from wifi but it doesn't. So that's why I'm confused on the price difference. The overall feel of it is fine. Not a lot thinner than the original. I keep mine in a case and whenever it goes idle I have to take it out of the case just to press the power button, which is pretty inconvenient. Oh and it freezes when charging which made me extremely nervous the first time because I thought it was broken but I just held the power button for like ten seconds and it was fine... other than those very minor complaints,I love it. I find myself reading way more than watching tv these days so that's always a plus!",2015-04-24T00:00:00.000Z,corimaysss

The screen's front-lit display allows me to read under all lighting conditions, from bright sunlight to dark, without eyestrain.I bought the Paperwhite as a supplemental reader for my Samsung tablet so that I could read outside. After several months of use, I'm finding that I do all my reading on the Paperwhite.I read several hours a day and the battery lasts four or five days under that usage, which is a great change from my tablet, which needed a recharge daily, usually at an inconvenient time.I recommend buying the companion leather case because the case puts the Paperwhite to sleep with the cover is closed, extending battery life.",2016-05-20T00:00:00.000Z,TomMadison

I have been using Apple, Windows, and Android for the past few years and never gave Amazon a chance - until a Black Friday deal at Best Buy.It is responsive, visually great, and the OS is quite easy to navigate. I set this up with my younger son in mind, and the parental controls are superb. They covered everything I could think of to prevent him from doing. Amazon also has plenty of cases to choose from for their own tablets.The only thing, and this just may take time, is that I wish the app library was more extensive compared to Apple and Android. Other than that, everything else is Excellent!",2016-01-02T00:00:00.000Z,Carlos
AVphgVaX1cnluZ0-DR74,This is a useful tool ---- Everyone needs one.,4,Amazon,"My first purpose was to use the tablet for taking photos cuz the boyfriend got a new Samsung. This item was in the right price range and I was not aware BestBuy sold the KINDLE FIRE - and was not aware is does more than download books, too. It is much faster to get online WiFI - much better than a pc. I have pleasantly surprised at the many uses the Fire has. I have found myself playing games on it & normally I do not play any on the PC - so if I am watching tv, I can sit here with inexpensive entertainment. Light weight, easy to carry, quick to use for camera(all kinds of settings-who knew) - Right price. Great for sending and receiving email. I suggest getting a 'stylus' for using with keyboard- and one may adjust the 'font' size for easy reading - Enjoy!",2016-06-17T00:00:00.000Z,MsdeeDub16

I use Alexa to listen to my favorite TuneIn radio station in a foreign country, set timers when I'm cooking, ask the time in different cities in the world or basic culture questions. She responds to everything. If I want to play music, she will default to Amazon Prime. If you have the membership, it is very convenient to have Alexa. I have even placed orders on Amazon with my voice. I also have Hue lights so Alexa is the one turning off my house lights at the end of the day...ah, and I can ask her to do so from the upstairs level. I think this purchase is one of the best I've made this year. I am sure there is much more to tap on (no pun intended), and I'll find out as I use Echo more.

It's sometimes hit and miss with Alexa but overall, it's nice to have something that can set timers for the kids, play music, and as the software improves, I can see this being even better. The integration of the Skills and functionality could certainly improve but overall, it's one of those convenience things that you can live without it but it sure is nice.

AVphPmHuilAPnD_x3E5h,Best Kindle yet,5,Amazon,"I just upgraded from a Touch to a Voyage and could not be happier. In my opinion this is by far the best Kindle yet. Its operation and features are similar to the Touch and Paperwhite but it is lighter and faster and very comfortable in the hand. Like other e-ink devices (unlike Fire) the screen has a matte finish which is really superb for reading. Some early reviews I've read complained about part of the screen having a yellowish hue. I have not seen any sign of this so that may have been an early manufacturing issue that hopefully has been corrected. The built-in screen light is amazing.Like other e-ink devices the Voyage allows better control and integration of dictionaries, which is really important for specialized reading or reading in a foreign language where one may want to consult several dictionaries in-situ to fully understand a word or phrase.There is very little not to like about the Voyage. I can only think of two issues to consider:1. Price - no doubt about it, Voyage is expensive, but in my opinion it is worth it. When trading off price and performance, I urge you to go into your nearest Best Buy for a hands-on look at the various Kindles, particularly the Paperwhite and Voyage to see what you really need/want or can live with.2. A minor point for the evolution of e-ink readers: it would be nice if there was some control of the screen background color or at least an implementation of a warmer background. Recent studies suggest adverse effects, particularly regarding getting good sleep, from using electronic devices with bright-white or bluish screens (disrupts melatonin production in the body). This is one (of the few in my opinion) advantages of Kindle Fire and Kindle for Android, where several text background colors are available).I highly recommend Voyage - the new king of e-readers.",2015-01-12T00:00:00.000Z,mjcatt

I was buying it thinking that it would be cut-rate but ok for a small child to play with on long car rides and on rainy days. Despite the low cost and unimpressive stats I have been very surprised by the quality. The screen is perfectly adequate for games and kids shows, the parental controls/child profile settings are excellent and the stereo speakers CRUSH the built in speakers on my iPad Air 2. The only drawbacks I have found so far are power related. The battery seems to drain fairly quickly under what I would consider normal use and the included charger (typical usb type) takes a very very long time to fully charge the tablet. I suspect this is the charger's limitation rather than the tablet's and it may charge better with a different power supply.I wish that I had purchased two of these tablets at the price they were for sale and I would have kept the second for my own use when on the road.",2017-06-04T00:00:00.000Z,LittleAVGuy

AVzvXXxbvKc47QAVfRhy,"This thing is awesome! Here's why you need it. 13,",5,Amazon,"Since the Fire TV stick was announced, I've heard a lot of people wonder if it was something worth picking up, essentially asking what does this thing do that my TV doesn't do already The answer is going to be different for different people, but here's an easy way to think about it Amazon Fire TV Stick is an excellent purchase if:-Your TV is not a smart TV. Meaning your TV or dvd player did not come pre-loaded with apps such as Netflix, Youtube, Pandora etc...-Your TV is a smart TV, but apps do not perform well. Some smart TVs have painful performance when streaming video, apps can be difficult to update, wifi connection can be spotty etc...-You want to access Youtube, Netflix, Amazon Prime, Pandora, and other such apps on your TV-You are an Amazon Prime Member and want to access your Prime Video, Prime Music, and Prime Photo accounts-You want to participate in casual gaming on your television.-You want to listen to music on your TV-You want to have portability. In other words, Television access to the above services while you are travelling. (Amazon says the capability to use in hotels/dorms etc... with shared wifi that requires frequent password entry is coming soon)So, the bottom line is that the Fire TV Stick allows you to access your movies, music and photos as well as games and more via your television. If your TV already does these things well, or you're already doing them via other devices such as a game console, then this may not be worth your while.So, how easy is it to use I'm telling you, you do not have to have an ounce of technological know how to have this thing up and running in a matter of minutes.Read more",,Mike W.

AV1YE_muvKc47QAVgpwE,One of the best streaming devices available,5,Amazon Fire Tv,"One of the best streaming devices available currently especially for the cost. The app store gives you access to all the major streaming services - Amazon Prime, Hulu, Netflix, HBO Go, etc. The only knock on it is that it places heavy focus on Amazon Prime videos for obvious reason. As a side benefit (pun intended) - you can put SPMC/Kodi/XBMC on it like I have and combined with a HDHOMERUN it is now a cable box replacement. It is the only box I have plugged into my TV and use it for Live TV, DVR, Movies, Videos, Pictures, and all the streaming apps. Powerful little unit that saves on electricity and space compared to HTPC that was hooked up before.

AVpfl8cLLJeJML43AE3S,Best Accessory for a smart home,5,Amazon,"I have recently purchased a home, and I have been set on a mission to make my home as connected as possible. Finding the right product lineup has been interesting.However, the Alexa product was a no brainer. In our house we are Amazon Prime members, so we can take advantage of the music and 2-day shipping orders from Alexa. These are after thoughts, as I bought Alexa to control my smart home setup with my voice.Many believe you can just buy Alexa and control your home. This is not the case. You can use Alexa as a smart home hub with WeMo products, but this uses Wifi and the devices easily connect and disconnect throughout the day if not setup properly.In my setup, I have a Wink hub connected to z-wave products around the home. Wink can also connect to online services like Google's Nest Services and Chamberlin MyQ garage, but unfortunately they are not able to be directly controlled by Alexa for the Wink Hub.With that being said, for Z-Wave and Zigbee products, I can tell Alexa to turn on and off these products. As well as, if setup with a dimmer, what percentage to set them at. Often times this is quicker than the Wink app itself.Pros:Wink Compatible.Logitech Harmony Hub Compatible.Nest Compatible.IFTTT Compatible.Can read Audible Audio Books.Sound from speaker can fill a fair sized family room.Makes home automation more intelligent.Cons:Sometimes doesn't respond appropriately.Price is a bit high.To summarize, the Alexa functionality of this product is limited. Unless you have Amazon Prime or devices that can attach to it, using its enabled skills. Would recommend as an accessory to a smart home, or for someone invested in the Amazon Eco System.",2017-01-16T00:00:00.000Z,Daviathon

AVqkIiKWnnc1JgDc3khH,Serves my tablet needs perfectly,5,Amazon,"For the price this is an excellent tablet. I have a high end laptop that does convert to tablet but at almost 16"" and the foldover design I normally just use it in laptop mode. I also have a high end ""phablet"" sized phone. So I was not sure how often I'd use a tablet, and did not want to spend 500ish on an ipad. The Fire has been a great ""in between"" so far on days I use my phone alot and want to avoid charging more than once per day, and don't have the need to use my laptop. The speed is zippy & the screen clarity/quality is good enough. Storage is even better than ipads since it is expandable (for now I use a 64 gb card giving me a total of 96 gb, but the expandable can go up to 200 gb). Tying into Amazon is nice since I have Amazon Prime). Basic web surfing, email & facebook work great. The only ""bad"" feature is the camera & video quality. But that does not matter to me since I have my high quality camera & video recorder on my phone. Only other slight negative is light bleed noticed just when booting up on grey screen. Color/brightness uniformity is perfect to my eyes once it is up & running. Really enjoying the kindle component for book & magazine reading as well. Overall, probably the best $100 I have spent in a long time.",2016-12-04T00:00:00.000Z,SpartyForLife

AV1YE_muvKc47QAVgpwE,Can't beat the features for the price point,5,Amazon Fire Tv,"I just bought a 4K tv so I wanted to make certain that I obtained a media player that delivered 4K content. I looked that the Roku, Apple TV, but I settled on the Amazon Fire TV because of my previous Amazon account and the price point. The device is quite elegant with a small form factor. The remote is equally small and minimal in form but quite effective. The mic works great to interact with Alexa. Just for fun, I found it interesting that Alexa will answer a question comparing it to Siri, but Siri does not reciprocate.I like that Amazon has deals to allow HBO GO streaming on it, whereas my Sony TV was not allowed to thanks to some deal between Comcast Xfinity and the networks. Other apps such as Youtube and Sling also work just fine on the app. It also syncs up to your Amazon account and on some songs, lyrics will appear on the screen like some sort of karaoke service. I thought that was a nice feature.I wish there were a few more options on it to customize loadout or app management. Also, at times the device would disconnect from my N network and connect to the G band for some reason, forcing me to manually reset it. I wish it would automatically connect to the higher band, but it's a minor complaint. The bottom of the remote can scratch easily as well, so don't slide it across the coffee table as I am apt to do.Overall, this is a great product and I have no regrets purchasing it.",2016-03-07T00:00:00.000Z,Paul12345

I had the apple tv for about 3 years before this and compared the amazon fire to the newest apple tv when I made this choice. The services I use (netflix and hulu plus) were available on both but since I am also a amazon prime member and the shows are generally cheaper via the amazon store I chose the fire tv. The set up was easy and I like the user interface. The system response is snappy compared to the older apple tv but I am noticing a bit more random resets and freezing with the fire tv. I suspect it's software related and can get worked out with updates. I think it's solid and would recommend the fire tv to anyone asking.,2015-12-18T00:00:00.000Z,joelb52

Next, store doesn't tell you about all the ads offers that come with it and you must pay $15 to disable them. Performance is slow; keypad is slow, am typing faster than it can register resulting in lots of typos. Watching movies is decent, but sound could be better. It drops WiFi more than I'm used to. Have several apps that cannot be installed on it and a few that consistently crash. Good battery kifre, but Quite slow to recharge. Sometimes the ""keys"" stick and can't get out of something even with home key, must restart. Thought this would be cheap temporary solution but this is better served by my 5 year old grandson.I got $50 worth of tablet.Compared to the look and feel of my old iPad, its like I'm still using a VCR and everyone else is on blue ray.",2015-11-27T00:00:00.000Z,Soul

AVphgVaX1cnluZ0-DR74,Great tablet for a great price,5,Amazon,"I am amazed with this tablet. For the price I expected something cheaply made to last a short while. I was wrong!! Very sturdy yet light enough not to give you hand/arm cramps while holding it for long periods of time. If you have any downloads you will need a separate SD card for memory. The down side to this is that if you do not install it before you start using it, you may have to reboot the tablet to get it to engage your new memory. The standard 8 gig will only hold what the machine needs and maxing out the internal memory may make it lock up. I put in a 32 gig card and downloaded several movies and books and it still have a ton more space and runs really fast (no streaming issues). We recently took it on a week long vacation and it was great to have downloaded games, books, movies, etc for the teens to watch/play.

I've also been very happy with the page turn buttons. It makes it significantly more convenient to turn pages than using the screen and the pressure and feedback both seem about right. The only issue I have that keeps this from earning 5 stars is that the backlight on the screen has a slightly two-tone hue. It is somewhat yellowish on top and bluish on the bottom of the screen. It isn't something that really distracts from reading but it is noticeable when looking for it. Fix this so the coloring is even and it is really a perfect ereader.",2015-01-16T00:00:00.000Z,Jeff

Also, something I discovered on my own that the ""experts"" in the stores did not know or tell me: even though you don't have a 4K capable TV, the Fire Box may still be what you want instead of the Fire Stick...here's why: when you watch live news or sports they are broadcast at 30 frames per second. The Fire Stick only can produce 20 frames per second, so the picture looks somehow ""previously recorded""...jusy not like a sharp, high-def pucture. So I replaced the Fire Stick on my 1080p capable TV with the Fire Box and, BINGO!, perfect...because it can reproduce 30 frames per second!

AVpff7_VilAPnD_xc1E_,"This box is a GAME CHANGER for on demand content! Amazon knocked it out of the park. Refreshed UPDATED with Tips! and HBO GO! 26,764 people found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you Yes No",5,Amazon,"I am not a casual user of on-demand content and devices. Having tried smart tv's from 3 brands, smart dvd/bluray players, Apple TV, WDTV, HTPC, Chromecast and too many other competing products to mention--for streaming content, before this box you really had two options (for a simple to use box that doesn't require additional items or tweaking):First is Apple TV which is easy to use (interface) but Apple limits the content you can get greatly (including no Prime Streaming built in) and it lacks a lot in features as well and is slow. The reason for selecting Apple TV is if you have other apple products that unlock features (like Amazon's content).The second option you could consider was Roku--which really means a Roku 3 box since it is heads and tails better than past Roku boxes in terms of remote and speed. Now Roku stands out with the most content and the most features of any box with the Roku 3. It is for that reason you will see me address the Roku 3 so often in this review.I have added quick summaries of other options to make sure everyone knows about the other options out there.WDTV: Are great for streaming your own content but not very user friendly.Chromecast: Is very cheap at 35 but requires other items to use (no remote included!), is limited to 16 channels according to their own site with other content broadcast via Chrome's browser not at the same quality level. This does allow you to browse the internet on your tv and is amazing for the cost but is more of a niche market than FireTV/Roku/Apple TV. But if you can live with the short comings, it is worth a look at 1/3 the price of these devices.Smart TVs: Most of these are FINE for occasional use but not nearly as pleasant to use daily like separate boxes.Read more",,William Hardin

AVphgVaX1cnluZ0-DR74,"Awesome entry level tablet, perfect for young kids",5,Amazon,"We purchased this tablet for my daughter for Christmas. She is in kindergarten, and her school allows them to take a device in to use in class. For $39 I couldn't beat that. Especially since i'm not going to send a 5 year old to school with an iPad!This tablet uses FireOS, which is Amazon's customized version of Android. Typically when I look at an android tablet, major deviations from vanilla Android will make me deduct ratings. The parental controls override any rating deduction in my mind. This tablet has the best parental controls I have ever seen! In addition, the alterations to the home screen make navigation pretty easy for my daughter. All in all this is a win win!The thing that has really impressed me has been the speed and responsiveness. Don't get me wrong, this is not a premium or flagship tablet by any means. With that being said, I have used Android tablets in this price range, and they are garbage! My wife has an insignia tablet that cost $70. It has a higher res screen and a few more features, but it nowhere near as responsive. When it dies it will probably be replaced by an Amazon Fire tablet!Keep in mind, Amazon is trying to hook you into their ecosystem. There are separate home screens for various types of content that Amazon delivers. Your books on one screen, or you can swipe to music on another, etc. From what I see there is no way to have more than one screen of apps. The nice thing about the Amazon ecosystem is that it is cross platform. They maintain apps for Android, iOS, Roku, Windows, MacOS, and so on. Also, their app store is not as extensive as the Google Play Store, so I may end up doing some side loading. That isn't hard, and instructional guides are available online for you.So in conclusion, this is a nice entry level tablet. I would bump up to the Fire HD8 for the extra features if buying for myself. However if buying for younger children or if you're really tight on cash you can't beat it! My twin boys are about to turn 3, and these might be on their list for birthday time!",2016-12-30T00:00:00.000Z,rksj0000

His vocal skills have improved and he is saying and identifying letters- and it has to be because of the tablet. I'm impressed at how well it holds his attention.

They work perfectly.The only downside I have seen so far is , I have a bluetooth speaker that I play music thru, and its paired with one echo, but if you are near a different echo and ask it to play music, it will not default ro the one with the speaker, but start playing thru the echo itself.I have not searched for a work around, and its possible that this is just my own setup mess up.. so I will still give 5 stars.",2017-01-17T00:00:00.000Z,Atxgeek

AVphgVaX1cnluZ0-DR74,I don't recommend it.,1,Amazon,"This 7"" 2015 version should have been marketed to children only. It's like a very ""dumbed"" down, cheap version of the better FireHD and HDX. Screen is not as good, battery life is bad, no mirroring to TV and it's slooowww as can be. If you've never owned another kind of Kindle you will probably be accepting of this watered down version. For those that know what a real kindle should be like, you may want to pass on this one. Another version should be along soon and since they can't get much worse than this one you'll probably get a better one. I got mine on Black Friday for a little over $30. total with shopping discounts and I'm still sending it back! That's how disappointed I am with it.",2015-12-03T00:00:00.000Z,Mamland

AVpfl8cLLJeJML43AE3S,4.5 Stars w/the benefit of updates over time!,5,Amazon,"So we have been getting our home setup for automation for a while now. Buying one piece at a time and implementing them makes the cost less scary! We have a Wink hub, Cree LED lights, MyQ garage door opener, AT&Ts Digital Life security and automation, Nest thermostat, etc. It has been a blast getting all of this working together and seeing how it can really benefit us in real life rather than in cheesy video clips on YouTube of people smiling and hugging while they turn the thermostat down a degree with their phone. You may be wondering how the Echo fits into this review...well before Alexa came into our lives we had to have a phone or tablet on us, unlock it, find the relevant app, open it and select the action to turn off a light or whatever we wanted to do. Now, we just say, ""Alexa, bedroom light 10%"" or ""Alexa, turn the bedroom lamp off"" or ""Alexa, play Bloodhound Gang on Spotify"", etc. The Echo makes utilizing your home automation much easier, plus with the ever growing list of 'skills' I can start my car, play a game, listen to music, get my news, control media playback, order a pizza, buy stuff from Amazon, even schedule an Uber pickup, etc. If your specific car or app or whatever isn't available yet, just give it some time and it'll most likely end up supported!

AV1YE_muvKc47QAVgpwE,Fast friendly interface to streaming entertainment,5,Amazon Fire Tv,I had a 3 year old Roku stick which was a lot better than broadcast antenna service but with the Roku stick I often waited through long pauses while the data was buffering. The Fire TV (2015 model) is a small box on my flat screen TV stand which provides a fast friendly interface to fast streaming entertainment and almost no buffering waits. I like the small tapered remote control which is light and easy to hold and point while browsing the many options.

AVphgVaX1cnluZ0-DR74,A Great Buy at $50,4,Amazon,"For what the Kindle Fire does, at $50, it's practically a steal. The reason why I bought the Fire was because it's excellent 'Read Aloud' function. There are many books that do not come in Audiobook format, which I need- I don't have as much time as I would like to sit down and read these days. The Kindle Fire has allowed me to finally get to these books, while I'm working out, or driving.Good points:It reads aloud very well, with several fairly natural sounding voices.Amazon can convert most PDFs into a readable format, and you can change the speed. Battery lasts pretty wellBad Points:The Fire's OS could use some reworking- switching bluetooth on and off isn't exactly convenient, being buried under a few menus, which don't seem to be customizable.All in all, it's a great buy at $50!",2016-11-17T00:00:00.000Z,ReaderRob

I'm invested in the Amazon ecosystem via Kindle e-readers and Fire TV's. This tablet is incredibly affordable and offers acceptable performance but it's heavily restricted if you do not figure out how to install the Google Play store as the Amazon App Store is missing a huge number of ""every day apps"". It's a great extension for Fire TV's and it's certainly a good choice as a primary tablet for kids or parents who don't have an Apple budget.

The quality of this Amazon Fire tablet is really great. It is not HD, but that doesn't matter to my 9 year old, who uses it to play games and listen to music. It has extremely robust parental controls, allowing parents to set a child profile and then set screen time limits, bedtimes, and limit content available. The child profile is actually a little too restrictive in my opinion, as I think my 9 year old could handle something in between full unrestricted access to amazon content and kiddie games only.

AVphgVaX1cnluZ0-DR74,Really surprized & impressed by price & quality!,4,Amazon,"I had 2 other tablets that worked terrible. It wouldn't even take e-books from the Library! But this is the perfect balance between an e-reader that could get boring to some people, & a tablet, that uses up the battery real quick. And you don't have to connect to a computer to download the e-books either, which is a real convenience!! So I would have to say this cute little tablet is really a lifesaver for a lot of really Poor people, that can't afford to buy expensive electronics. If they lose it, breaks. or gets stolen, they could easily just go buy a brand new one. The goal is to stay connected to the mainstream. It is easy to carry on the bus, bring to the park, maybe a classroom, or library, dining room, coffee shop. And not a big worry about losing a lot of $, if it got lost. Plus, with the ""Amazon Cloud"", You would never lose any of the e-books, that you paid for, & can use on all you devices. This should be considered a Gift-package from Amazon, especially for new people that never had a chance to own their very Tablet, & always have to run to the library, or borrow someone else's.

I've had phones and tablet with the same resolution, but never one that looked quite as lack luster as this display. They are OK for the kids to beat around with because they broke the last tablet they had. This one probably wont last much longer, but it's cheap. I wish I would have spent a few more bucks and gotten better ones for my wife and I, though.If you want a disposable tablet or color reader for magazines and such, you'll probably be OK with this.If you want a good tablet, think about buying a good tablet.",2016-01-08T00:00:00.000Z,David

For 20 you don't even get a full charger, just an adapter to put on to the cord they already gave you.

AVpfl8cLLJeJML43AE3S,Love it...!!!,5,Amazon,"I got the Amazon Echo and the Dot to supplement it. Although they say that the Echo can hear from all over, it really can't. It depends how far you are and how loud the surroundings are (ie. television or stereo on or even if the Echo is playing loud music itself). So, I got the Dot for my bedroom and it works just fine.It's a little complicated to setup to the wifi but once I figured it out (I needed to turn off the automated wifi connection on my smartphone), it worked like a charm. After the Echo is connected to the wifi, you can turn the automatic wifi back onto your phone. I'm just getting started to using it with my Smart Home automation. So far, I can turn on/off & dim my lights in my living room with just my voice. Love it...!!! Once I get more bulbs for my bedroom and hallway, I'll add those too. It just gets expensive at $29.99 - $49.99 per bulb!!!Also, I wish you could re-name/call it something other than Alexa, Amazon or Echo.

It is a solid device - I have not encountered any glitches, freezes, or app crashes but it is not used as much as our other devices. I would recommend it if you consume Prime content or you are clumsy with electronics.Pros* Good value (almost disposable)* microSD slot* Underground* Multi-user support* Easy access to Prime contentCons* Amazon's Fire UI* Amazon's App Store* No support for Google apps such as YouTube, Gmail, etc.* Battery life could be better* No stock content producing apps like iMovie, GarageBand, etc/",2016-01-31T00:00:00.000Z,RhymePays

You have to purchase wifi/smart bulbs and switches before she can operate. One smart switch or wifi bulb can cist as much as $30. That's pretty steep to me.

It was easy to take and use on a recent trip, although the Delta app doesn't work with it so that was a little frustrating. Not crazy about seeing the ads that pop up, but for a purchase price of $65 (sale), it's hard to complain. This is my first tablet and I find it to be the perfect size and easy to use. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to buy a tablet and expects to use it for reading, surfing the web, playing games and as a lightweight device travel option. I am very happy with the look of the games and everything on the screen, I can see myself using it more at home now, although I will still use my laptop when I want a bigger screen. I bought it in the store & they were out of cases, so I recommend buying a case that also acts as a stand.

I had multiple apps open and it didn't feel too bogged down. If you can find it when it is on sale for $39.99, it's an even bigger steal.",2016-02-19T00:00:00.000Z,mmnc

AV1YE_muvKc47QAVgpwE,Best cable cutter solution,4,Amazon Fire Tv,"I am very happy with this device. I've tried many different solutions to get to a good cord cutting setup and this is by far the best. From cheap Android sticks, to Roku, to Chromecast, to small form factor PCs, this is the best compromise between size, performance, and price. We use it primarily with PlayStation Vue but also with Amazon Prime. Interestingly enough it has become our preferred device for Netflix as well, even though Netflix is built-in to our Samsung TV. The Bluetooth remote is very good, even though the voice search/Alexa services are little more than a novelty. To be truly useful Amazon needs to open voice search to other apps. I'd love to be able to say ""watch CNN on PlayStation Vue"". My biggest knock however is the limited libray of apps. For example, there is a free CBS app for Android but the app for the FireTV requires a subscription. Yes, you can side load apps but that defeats the simplicity that makes this device great. Similarly, the lack of Google Play Movies and Google Play Music is regrettable.On a side note, if you don't plan to play demanding games, the new FireTV Stick (quad core) is just as competent a devices as this one, for less than half the price. But I cannot recommend the old FireTV stick. One little advertised feature that I absolutely love is that the device will also connect to Bluetooth headsets. Awesome if you want to listen you a show in bed without disturbing others.",2016-10-28T00:00:00.000Z,Thecount

AVphgVaX1cnluZ0-DR74,I LIKE IT!!!,4,Amazon,"I am amazed at this little tablet! I had, and still have, a Kindle Paper White for 3 years before I dared to try to use it, and after using it I was intrigued by the possibilities.... I joined a public library and began reading books for free. When I had trouble downloading some books because they were EPUB instead of KINDLE, I decided to look into the FIRE. This FIRE cost me $39! Amazing. I don't use a SMART PHONE and normally only find myself online at home or someplace where I drag my laptop like a hotel or at Starbucks. This little number allows me a lot of flexibility. Besides downloading books, I can go online, I can download music from my AMAZON PRIME account for free (music that I don't want to pay for to get onto my IPOD CLASSIC). I can hook up the FIRE to my BOSE speakers and the sound is great! I already watched a PBS TV show on the FIRE while waiting to get an oil-change done on my car at the dealership. I added 64 gigs of memory for about $20, thinking that I might build quite a music library on this little machine. Since the memory is removable, if the tablet gets deep-sixed, no problem transferring the music elsewhere, I think! I have almost figured out how to get the music from the FIRE onto my MAC...but maybe it can't be done ... I don't know. AMAZON doesn't let you download from the PRIME music library to a computer...they only allow the download to tablets and phones. But there must be a way around this...I think it's been fun trying to figure it all out. On the downside, I hate the fact that the screen is not an anti-glare screen to begin with, but I bought something which I think will solve that problem. Don't like the fingerprints ... I'm trying to get used to the notion of a touch-screen. I'm OLD...I don't like change...so adapting is not that easy. But I'm working on it and I would say for the money, even adding the cost of the accessories I purchased, that this was a worthwhile meander into the realm of mobile connectivity. I'm having a lot of fun with it! The tablet DOES subject one to advertising when you open it...but I ignore it. I ignore all advertising everywhere so it's not hard for me to do...it's a well-ingrained habit. If I were forced to look at and read the advertising however, then I would consider a more expensive tablet that is free of advertising. But for the money you have to make allowances for commerce, I guess. I'm an APPLE person so I felt this would be very hard to figure out, but it's pretty intuitive after about 4 hours of making endless mistakes! LOL. I SAID I was old...don't expect to know what you are doing right away if you are essentially a technological idiot. Thing is you CAN figure it out. I don't read instructions so maybe if someone were more willing to have things explained to them it would be a shorter learning curve. But I only learn by trial and error. Have fun! Buy the thing...it's so cheap that if you hate it it's no big loss! The screen adjustments for reading are good...font size, background color, etc. I needed to have something that was easy on the eyes...this works for me!",2016-06-03T00:00:00.000Z,Sheri

AVphPmHuilAPnD_x3E5h,"Mostly Love It, a few glitches",4,Amazon,"First, the good news. The screen is a nice brightness and the words are crisp and clear. Best of all, it is so light and tiny (esp. in the Origami case) that it is super-easy to carry around in a purse. Love that. Also it has an amazing battery life; I have never had it run out on me and I don't even have to recharge it all the time. I thought this would be perfect but I am having two problems: (1) turning pages is not as easy or pleasant as my much-older, now-defunct Kindle. If I don't touch the screen in the right place, the page won't turn, and it usually has an annoying split-second black flash on the screen. The ancient Kindle was easier. (2) About half the time, when I return to reading, the screen is ""frozen"" on the ad. It says ""swipe to open"" but no amount of swiping gets it going. I have to reach to the rear of the kindle (which means disassembling the crimp in the Origami) to press the button on the back to get it to function again. There is no rhyme nor reason to when this happens but it's about half the time. Perhaps I am doing something wrong regarding both flaws but there is no one to ask about it, Best Buy staff doesn't know.",2016-01-12T00:00:00.000Z,Joan

Just make sure that your cable company is on the list of providers for standalone apps, e.g. HBO Go, Discovery, History, Travel Channel etc, else you'll find yourself not able to watch their specific content on this box. Bought it mainly because I use Playstation Vue to stream content and hate the tile setup on Roku. PS Vue on the Fire TV is a timeline setup, I prefer this much more than the Roku setup. Great box, works flawlessly with Alexa and Prime memberships. IMO, worth the $90, plus I got a free 30 day trial of Sling.

Can ask for driving times to destinations without an app, same for getting a cocktail recipe. Very dry responses where GH has personality.

I personally have HUE lights in several rooms in my house and the Echo pairs seamlessly with the HUE device, making controlling the lights via voice simple. The only touchy part with that is terminology you say to get the lights to turn on and off. I have only had my Echo for 2 weeks, so I am not an advanced Echo user by any means. However, this product seems to have endless capabilities and only developing more daily.My only problem came when trying to keep my Echo paired with my DISH box so I can control my TV with my voice. This feature seems to lose connectivity easily and has proven to be slightly difficult to re-pair after the initial pairing of the two devices.

Even with the aforementioned reasons for not getting one, I couldn't argue with that price. I think it's a great starter tablet. It may not have the largest screen or HD quality but then again I don't need all of that.

The 2 year warranty and free year access to kids content is amazing. The soft foam case provides coverage for drops, the battery life is good for a few hours of play time and the charge time is quick after.

AVphgVaX1cnluZ0-DR74,Nice basic tablet,4,Amazon,"It's a $50 tablet, you're not going to get all the bells and whistles. We got it for my toddler daughter to load apps, games and movies to take with her in the car/out to eat. You may already know that it does not come with standard Google apps so you cannot use your gmail to use apps from the Play store. There are workarounds found on YouTube that you can load Google apps through a 3rd party, and I easily did that but found that even those workarounds do not work for the Movies/TV app, so we can't watch any of her purchased movies on this which was the main objective. Apps and games load from your gmail fine so that is what she is now using it for. For $35 on Black Friday I guess it is still worth it. Just really wanted her movies on it.The UI is very basic and promotes purchases everywhere. The lock screen advertisement is obnoxious but I guess they have to make their money somewhere. I took all the bloatware Amazon apps that you can't delete and put them into a single folder to make it less cluttered with junk that my daughter wouldn't need. Also helping to avoid involuntary purchases. The camera is miserable on it, not that I ever use the camera even on my $500 Samsung, but just an FYI. Haven't used it enough to really comment on functionality or reliability. In the end, it's a >$50 tablet, but a decent one at that.

AVpfl8cLLJeJML43AE3S,Happy with my purchase,5,Amazon,"I purchase my Alexia about a month ago and waited to write this review in order to get more familiar with its operation. Set up was a breeze with no problems connecting to my home network. At present I am using my Alexia for my morning news briefs while having breakfast. Listening to Bloomberg, CNN, Fox, and Reuters news briefs you pretty much get an insight of whats happening in the world. If you wake her up by saying Alexia, good morning she will give you some interesting information concerning the day. I also use her for reviewing by daily schedule and local weather before heading out. No longer do I have to search in my iPad. Listing to music is a pleasure since the sound is very acceptable and I can change the volume or skip song without even moving. She response to my voice from across the room. The timer function is a help when cooking, and setting a alarm by voice is a great convenience, eliminating some use of my phone. It would be nice to have Alexia call your contacts on your phone with IFTTT but that would involve uploading your contact list to Amazon, something that at the moment I would not do. My future plan is to interface Alexia with a smart home system which will operate by voice control. I am happy with my purchase and would recommend Alexia to anyone.",2017-09-23T00:00:00.000Z,coquizap

I originally purchased this product specifically to attached to my Tablet Holder on my Nordic Track Treadmill, which already has a built-in tablet. However, I was so taken back by the versatility of the Fire HD 8 tablet that I decided to use the tablet as my everyday ""walk-about"" computer tablet instead on placing on my treadmill which I only use 1 to 3 times per week.

My wife is an average PC and smart phone user and has been gracious enough to put up with my desire to add automation to my home. Hands down we both agree that adding this was the best decision ever. Prior to adding the Amazon Echo to our home we would have to use the controller on the wall or an app on our phones to control lights, door locks, garage doors and thermostats. With a little bit of searching online you can find all the help you need to get Alexa linked to your other services and accounts. My Wink home automation shortcuts can now be set off by voice command. When I walk in the door with my arms full I simply say ""Alexa, turn on entry lights"". When it is time for the kids to get settled down I say ""Alexa, trigger reading mode"" and all lights are set to the desired levels. Time for bed? ""Alexa, trigger night mode"" and all lights shut off, garage door closes (if left open) and all deadbolts lock on exterior doors. Ask ""Alexa, what's up?"" and she gives current time, temps, forecast and top news. When we sat down with the kids to open Christmas gifts... ""Alexa, play some classic Christmas music"". No, I don't work for Amazon... I'm simply amazed at how far things have come. Get this product, be patient and do research if you are having issues and I'd be willing to bet that you'll love this product.",2017-01-19T00:00:00.000Z,mersettr

AVpg3q4RLJeJML43TxA_,"Does the job, but way overpriced",2,Amazon,"I don't want to get too negative on this, because it does what it's supposed to. However, I'm not sure how Amazon justifies charging 40! Half that and I'd feel a lot less disappointed. It's nothing like the last generation cover, which was hefty and substantial. That thing could take a beating! This one Umm...not so much.PROS:- I really like the solution Amazon came up with to lock the Kindle in place sort of a rubberized cup that grips it on all four sides and holds it VERY securely. No more metal-prong slide-release gizmo.- It looks quite nice and is genuine (if untextured) leather like the last one.CONS:- Flimsy. The leather is extremely thin and unpadded. Won't stand up to much abuse. scrape it even lightly on a rough surface and you'll likely ruin it.- The actual cover that folds over the front is incredibly floppy and delicate -- it's about the thickness of a piece of notepad cardboard. I could bend it in half with almost no effort, if I had the notion.- Cover has no lock/closure mechanism (like the elastic strap on the last gen model). It should have SOMETHING.Oh, well. It is what it is. I never read with the Kindle in the case anyway so it's not such a big deal to me, but I was expecting more. Especially for this price!",2011-11-18T00:00:00Z,K. English

AVpfl8cLLJeJML43AE3S,"Once you have it, can't do without it",5,Amazon,"I'm deepy invested in the Apple ecosystem so I approached using the Echo as a just something to experiment with. Now I understand Barry Diller's statement that eventually Jeff Bezos will be the richest man in the world. And for me it starts with the Echo. I use it from the (funny) morning alarm to bedtime when it manages my night time Hue light scenes. I prefer to listen to music through the Echo and not tie up my other devices. I've ordered several Dots and am looking forward to being able to use a more serious speaker for music. Now that I've been sucked into the Amazon universe I've abandoned my Apple TV and replaced it with the Fire TV becuase of the Alexa voice control. The kids use Alexa for homework and even my ""beyond cool"" teenage son admits it's a worthwhile technology. I have a lot of fun with the IFTTT recipes; its become a bit of a hobby. And rather than having a technology where you blink your eyes and it's out of date, the best thing so far about the Echo is it just keeps getting better with more product integrations, ""skills"", and ever expanding content. I recommend getting one soon so you can enjoy the new stuff as it comes along.",2016-10-16T00:00:00.000Z,Roljac

The new books should be downloaded to my Library in List Form as in the original Kindle. In addition, once you have looked at a book in the homepage, it disappears and you have to search for it or place it in a category.

AVphgVaX1cnluZ0-DR74,"It's no iPad, but useful",3,Amazon,"I bought one of these on Black Friday on impulse since it was $34.99 and I had a $5 certificate to use. I have a third generation iPad and am quite accustomed to using it and the App Store.Pros: OS is Android based and not too hard to pick up compared to Apple. I did find versions of a lot of favorite apps and games to download. It can take up to 128GB microSD card for expanding storage (only 8 GB built in). I got a 64 GB class 10 card at Costco for $20.Cons: screen resolution is only 1024 x 768, but I can't say it's super noticeable in normal use. Not all apps available even if an Android version exists. Much more useful if you have Amazon Prime as it ties directly to an Amazon.com account, and In fact you have to register the device before you can do much of anything on it. Battery life is not impressive either, with standby time in particular not great.For the price, it's a handy spare internet connected device.

Not having time to do them at home, I found apps that I could use on the cell phone while on the train. But, anything more than 125 pieces was just too many for the screen. I've found that I can do 225 piece puzzles comfortably on the Kindle and, for the amount of puzzles available and the time I can spend on them, that's good enough for me.But, the Kindle offers so much more. There are other great games and puzzle apps from the APP Store plus there's a six-month ""free"" trial subscription to the WASHINGTON POST. You can go online via WiFi and download books, read email, watch movies and videos, and surf the Internet, just like on a regular computer.It's great fun!",2017-01-15T00:00:00.000Z,Mariamne

So, we we arrived home, we began exploring what the Echo could do. Wow. It is amazing. We have been Amazon Prime members for many years and this is a logical extension of the Amazon ecosystem. I think most folks who use Prime will be pleasantly surprised by what it can do. However, not everyone likes it. My son-in-law says its creepy to have something listening to you in your home.

The touch screen capability makes it so much handier than turning pages and navigating with buttons, and the lighted display lets me sit and read wherever I like. These features use up battery a bit faster than the basic model, but recharging more frequently is not so bad considering the conveniences gained. I noticed one bothersome quirk, which is the reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. Sometimes it jumps ahead more than one page when I touch to turn. Checking online, I see that I'm not the only one experiencing this problem.

AVphgVaX1cnluZ0-DR74,Amazon Free Time Ad machine,3,Amazon,"My view comes from being only a IPad user. And my purchase purpose was for a very young granddaughter whose sole purpose right now is to steal my Ipad to watch YouTube cartoons, and she operates it very well.I'm giving this 3 stars because I'm returning this in less than 24 hours. So I didn't give this much of a chance. First it seems it REALLY wants you to sign up for Amazon Free Time ($4.99 month). Guessing my experience would be a whole lot smoother if I did that.So created the child profile on the tablet, moved the YouTube app to the profile. Opened the app and got selections for Popular, Music, Movies etc... Could not locate a ""search"" feature. After repeated tapping, got Music to open. Only to get a warning that ""this content is restricted in the Amazon Free Time app"". What? So I have to join to unlock YouTube? I'm technically savy so the fact that I was frustrated didn't bear well for the granddaughter. Maybe there was another way around this but I didn't look. Should not have to.Couple this with the random ads for games, Amazon Prime, etc that pops up and that was enough for me. So going back to get a Windows tablet where you click on the YouTube app you get what you are expecting without restrictions. For the $49.99 price I had to try this. But not for me.",2015-11-15T00:00:00.000Z,Scott

Now I can't imagine reading without it. After tons of booklights that died on me and heavy books that never fit in my bag. I can read anywhere, anytime, and in any lighting. I only wish the Kindle store was not so biased to kindle unlimited. It doesn't list the top books it lists people who pay the be on there. So you don't get genuine recommendations. Still, I will never read the same again. If you want to look up the mean of the word merely click it, if you want to make the font bigger you can do so, and if you want to see better raise the brightness. It's so much easier on the eyes than reading on my IPad.",2017-08-11T00:00:00.000Z,Sphoenix

It stores many books in a very small space and if she wants to reread a book she can simply go to her account and download it again if it's not on her Kindle. The battery lasts a long time too. She now takes it to school to read during down time. I took mine on a 2 week trip to the Galapagos. I used on in the airport, on my flights, and several times every day since there was no internet or tv on my ship. It took up very little space and weight on a restricted baggage limit and I didn't have to recharge it. Also, It's much easier to hold vs a big book.",2017-09-11T00:00:00.000Z,SCMom

They added ""blue shade"" to adjust the color of the screen when reading at night because exposure to blue light is supposed to impede sleep. When reading it learns your pace & gives you an estimate on when you will finish the book which I think is neat. Can watch Netflix/Hulu.

AVpfl8cLLJeJML43AE3S,Nice speaker with extra features,3,Amazon,"The echo is a nice speaker that has the added bonus of being able to respond to questions and give sometimes useful information. However in regards to it being capable of serving as the brain of an integrated, automated home, it lacks much. I purchased it to use with Philips hue bulbs and I was hoping my fire tv. Although it shares the same software with the fire, and logically should be able to work together, it does not. Echo will not connect to or control the tv. As far as the Philips hue bulbs, it can turn on individual bulbs, or even a group of bulbs IF, and only if, you remember the exact phrase or name you gave it. It cannot dim the lights, set light scenes or any of the cooler options the Philips hue bulbs are capable of. I wound up going back to using my iPhone which respond to voice command of 'hey Siri' better than the echo anyway. If I had to do it over again, I would have saved the money and gone with a simple Bluetooth speaker for my phone as it can already do many of the things the echo does. Only difference is that the phone doesn't have as big of a range for voice pickup.I did give the echo three stars, because the one thing it does well is respond to questions, like what's the weather like. That feature is interesting but not worth paying nearly $200 for.",2016-09-09T00:00:00.000Z,Melodybelle

It is a great way to tie all your smart home products together and to simply ask for something to happen. There are plenty of YouTube videos of unique ways to use Alexa. I use Wink (not too happy with it), but with Alexa, those products work very well. The speaker is excellent when you pair it to your phone to listen to music.

Examples are questions or requests such as ""how many calories are in a pop-tart"", searching for certain songs or types of music, and calculating time and distance between two cities by car. The Home was able to do all of these things while the Echo was not. The home also tends to provide information beyond the direct answer to your question while the Echo does not.

AV1YE_muvKc47QAVgpwE,The Only Way To Cut The Cord,5,Amazon Fire Tv,"If you want fast menus and stable streaming, avoid the WIFI only firestick, and get this FireTV. If you want reliable streaming that will not frustrate you, do the work of running an ethernet cable. This box with ethernet is head and shoulders better than a Firestick. Firestick streams well most of the time, but sometimes it struggles and you get errors with either DirecTV Now or PS Vue...forcing a device restart...very frustrating. This box plugged in with an ethernet cable streams perfectly on the same network with the same content 99.9% of the time. I eliminated conflicting frequencies, used 5 Ghz frequencies, have a great router, fast internet, I tried everything. The cure was this device hooked up by ethernet cable. The fact that you can put KODI on this box opens the whole world of movies up to you. You can also load Android apps from your phone to the device with Apps2Fire...I put Blue Iris on my FireTV. If have two of these in my home now, one in the Master Bedroom, and one on my 4K TV. There isn't a ton of 4k content yet, but you can go to Youtube and see some amazing video in 4k there. When I buy a new home at the end of the year I plan to run ethernet cable and have one of these at every television. I cut the cable company off 1 1/2 years ago and have never missed them. Other than internet, I pay $30 a month for PS Vue, and along with KODI I have everything I could possibly want and more. Goodbye Cable TV.",2017-05-19T00:00:00.000Z,mormandy3

AV1YnRtnglJLPUi8IJmV,Convenient and portable,4,Amazon,I was attracted by the price of the base Kindle but in the end opted for the Paperwhite as it was illuminated and had rounded edges which felt more comfortable. Definitely worth the extra few dollars in my opinion. My local library offers free loans of ebooks which I have been taking advantage of. There are also many free books online - samples and classics with expired copyrights. Battery life is good and the device is lightweight. Even in bright ambient light you get minimal screen glare. I prefer this to a physical book which I never expected.,2016-11-27T00:00:00.000Z,TAEng

AV1YE_muvKc47QAVgpwE,Great product but the remotes are junk.,3,Amazon Fire Tv,I have bought 3 of the amazon fire tv boxes. I love how many online services you can access via the fire. I would rate this a perfect 5 if it was not for the fact that the fire remote is so poorly made. 2 of the 3 remotes died before the batteries did. Sure you can use your phone to control the fire tv box but that is slow and should not have to be done. And dont try to get help from Amazon their idea of help is to have you buy a new fire tv box.,2017-07-19T00:00:00.000Z,Poorremote

Still has a few things I don't like - kind of slow, insists on me using the Silk browser, I don't like that I can't delete certain pre-loaded apps that I will never use. There are some apps that aren't available for it, like Chromecast. For the price, it's a good little tablet for internet, reading, simple games, checking email and WatchESPN.

I also have the Bose sound link mini and have to say the sound quality for music is better on the Bose if music is the sole reason for your purchase. For information and requesting a quick song or radio station, this thing rocks. You have to take time letting Alexa learn your voice but overall, the voice recognition is much better than Siri. My one complaint is that it doesn't sync with my Apple Calendar. Come on Amazon, cut a deal with Apple! Anyway, I give this a thumbs up and a 4 star rating. Get one.

If you're looking for a tablet that you can play games on, browse through Facebook or instagram on, or even surf the net then you're better off getting an upgraded version of this tablet or an iPad as I said before.

I do advise you to set up an Amazon account prior to make the setup easy. I am an Amazon Prime Member, but it's not necessary to use the fireTV. I also purchased the fireTV stick for a 2nd bedroom. I will tell you though, the FireTV is worth the extra money. Not only is the FireTV still small, but it has 4k definition and you can use Ethernet and Wi-Fi. The biggest difference between this and the Fire Stick is that fireTv has expandable memory, excellent to add photos, apps, movies etc. The app store on the device also has games you can play on the fire tv and for an extra $40 you can get a remote that looks like an xbox controller.",2017-04-24T00:00:00.000Z,jconte

AVpfIfGA1cnluZ0-emyp,Solid Charger,4,Amazon,"As a standalone charger, this one does pretty good and I like the versatility to charge other items with the USB female plug vs. something hardwired that allows me to charge other USB-type devices in addition to something that uses a micro USB port.Charging time is faster for a Kindle Fire vs. my regular e-Ink Kindle charger, but since I haven't - and rarely - fully drain one of my Fires I cannot comment on the faster aspect for charging a Fire: I just know it works, and it does seem to charge my phone faster than the plug that came from Verizon. Thats not a shocker as this one is 9 watts vs. 5 for the normal charger.This is a replacement model to the original 9W PowerFast charger. Rather than the prior models square look this one is longer in a rectangular form and sticks out further from the socket. That seems to add more clutter to a wall socket. This years model also has rigid prongs (what you stick into the electrical socket) vs. the fold-down version of the prior model that gives it a lower profile. I didnt think too much of it at first, but the longer profile of the rectangular design, in addition to the electrical prongs not folding down into the charger, means it takes up a little bit more room in my laptop bag. Thats not good for me as now it wont fit in a side pocket for my brand of laptop bag and goes into the general pile of stuff that floats around in the main bag.19.99 seems to be a lot for an adapter of this power size, and it is: despite my comments on the changes above, the PowerFast chargers Amazon makes do seem to last. Ive never had one break as other brands do, I just keep leaving them in random hotels and airports while traveling and have to buy another! If you are looking for a solid and longer-lasting charger for your tablet, I would recommend this one.",,Michael Gallagher

The second issue I've found with this type of tablet is that it's made out of plastic & its noisy. The overall performance is quite impressive though.

AV1YE_muvKc47QAVgpwE,Almost...,2,Amazon Fire Tv,"It's somewhat of a step up from the Roku 3 I was previously using, but not as much as I was expecting. I think it's a couple firmware updates away from being better than it is now.Spent the good part of the day trying to figure out why I could only connect to my dual-band router at 2.4GHz and not 5GHz. 1.5 hours on the phone with Verizon FiOS tech support was unsuccessful as other devices connected at 5GHz without issue. Was about to pack it up and return it until I called Amazon tech support. Turns out it's a known-issue that the FireTV has difficulty with 5GHz networks that are set to auto channel selection and are utilizing channel numbers above 100.The tech support person said I should change the channel to 36, 44, or 48 instead of automatic, and, it worked.Bluetooth audio and video are out of sync with Showtime, Netflix, Sling, Plex and Hulu. It's fine through speakers, but video lags slightly behind the audio using Bluetooth. Audio and video are in perfect sync with Bluetooth and Amazon Prime Video which makes me think it'll be fixed at some point, as Amazon provided video demonstrates it can work well in that regard.Gotta say I prefer the platform agnostic UI of Roku, with Amazon-world tucked away in an app. The FireTV navigation pane represents mostly Amazon products with no option to modify it. Roku's UI is more about the media, less about the provider. Voice search works well if you want only to be presented with Amazon's viewing options, for some reason I thought search was universal, but only movies and TV shows available through Amazon show up. Bummer :-(The FireTV-2 is OK, less than I was expecting and with other good options around the corner, I'm beginning to doubt my choice...",2015-10-07T00:00:00.000Z,benjitek

I've decided to return this and exchange for another $50 tablet tomorrow. This is because I couldn't even watch a simple youtube video today.Here's what I did like. It's name brand. The games are nice and mostly ad free. It uses Android 5.0 but uses their own app store. Reading books is great.

Currently I have two Wemo plugs and Phillips Hue lightbulbs set up to my Echo and plan on adding more Alexa-compatible smart devices. I love how easy and seamless it is to get all my devices working off Alexa. It's also a bluetooth speaker and can get very loud.

AV1YnRtnglJLPUi8IJmV,Excellent eReader,4,Amazon,"Purchased to replace an older model that died during a software update (lost wifi connection during the download, bricking the kindle). This model has 300dpi, up from 220 on the previous model. With text it is barely, if at all, noticeable. With any kind of graphics or cover images, the increase in resolution is nicer. Unfortunately the lighting remains uneven at the bottom of the screen as it was in the previous generation. The voyager model supposedly has better lighting but at twice the price it wasn't worth it to me. And the uneven bottom lighting isn't bad, but it is there and I would have thought Amazon would have fixed that by now. Maybe it is a limitation of having 4 light sources vs the 6 on the voyager. Still, the lighting is not bad and this is a very nice eReader. Noticed the background is a touch more beige than the grey on the previous model which is a welcome subtle change, easier on the eyes. Like too that the font is a dark grey versus pitch black which also reduces eye strain especially for those with dyslexia who can be sensitive to harsh contrasts. Overall, highly recommended. Best eReader for the price.",2016-11-17T00:00:00.000Z,Jeff

I have to say it's really nice to just read my shopping list to Echo and have it on my phone for when I go to the grocery store. I've also done away with my alarm clock in my bedroom and use the echo as my alarm clock and weather station. If it's searchable on the Internet, Echo can usually answer your questions.

AVphgVaX1cnluZ0-DR74,"4-star tablet, 5-star value",5,Amazon,"Apples & oranges. They're both fruit, both tasty, but they are different at the same time.When thinking about the new $50 7"" Fire tablet, keep in mind that this is not a high-end Samsung or iPad Mini. It does a lot of the same things, but it's different. It costs a fraction of the cost. With that perspective in mind, this is a fantastic value. In fact, short of finding a nice, 2nd-tier Asus , LG, or Lenovo tablet being pushed on discount sites, probably as refurbs, you're not going to find anything that comes close in value to this new Fire tablet.Prior to getting it, I had my concerns, particularly with the screen given the lower resolution. I have a dozen tablets, and have tried about a dozen others, and screen quality is not something you want to scrimp too much on. Amazon got this right. It is not as crisp as my older Kindle Fire HD 7"" or my Galaxy Note 8.0 or my iPad Mini, but for casual reading, gaming, video viewing, email, etc., the screen is just fine. Worlds beyond most low-end/budget tablets I've tried (especially anything costing under $100 new). My daughter, who has been using a Kindle Fire HD 7"", has not cared one bit about the slightly lower screen resolution.The new Fire OS operating system looks & feels much more like Android or iOS, which is nice overall. It still is not perfect, but overall I think it makes for a much better user experience than the version on older Kindle Fire tablets.The 8GB of internal storage is, of course, paltry, but with the very welcome addition of a microSD slot, carrying loads of media with you for offline consumption is not an issue. What remains to be seen is how performance is impacted if/when the little bit of available internal storage gets filled with apps and other content. So far, this has not been a problem.The inclusion of both front- and rear-facing cameras is a nice bonus. No, you're not going to capture great shots. But both cameras are usable and add value.The speakers are OK. Volume and quality is not great, but is acceptable for general use - and, of course, you can also use headphones or an external speaker to kick things up a notch (or several notches).If you have $150 or more to spend on a tablet, and plan on using it quite a bit, then you can definitely find something a bit nicer. If you're getting this for just occasional use, or for a kid, and are not accustomed to using a high-end tablet, then this is a fantastic buy. I've tested over 20 tablets and for a sub-$100 tablet, this is absolutely a great value. At its current price of $50, it's a no-brainer. Kudos to Amazon for raising the bar on budget tablets AND making quality tablets available to the masses.",2015-10-16T00:00:00.000Z,MobileTrekker

I likely will buy another just for reading for myself since they're smaller and lighter and easier price wise to replace than my iPad. Just a forewarning, the kindle store can be a little wonky and less streamlined in aligning purchases. I wish there was a restore purchases button like in the Apple Store since I've bought stuff in games to have the content disappear...

Several of my friends told me about the Amazon Firebox and how it helped in reducing high cable TV bills. I even had to be reminded that if you are a Prime customer, you get the Amazon Channel at no additional cost. With all the free channels Amazon Firebox provides, being an Amazon Prime customer adds even more channels to choose from and offers movies, tv shows, etc. Now to be fair, it���s not cable. I miss cable, but I don���t miss those high cable bills. You can also link your Netflix, Hulu, and other accounts to your Amazon Firebox making it the only place for home entertainment. Although you have to keep an eye on the premium channels offering free 7 day trials and remember to put a security code on your remote in order to avoid guests, kids, and other persons from ordering a bunch of the pay channels provided on Amazon Firebox. Other than that, I am one happy customer.",2017-06-12T00:00:00.000Z,WJonesII

AV1YE_muvKc47QAVgpwE,The most versatile option of the streaming boxes,4,Amazon Fire Tv,"I own all three of the latest Fire TV, Roku and Apple TV. Out of the three, as a pure streamer, I'd say Roku is probably my favorite followed by Apple TV and then Fire TV. However, as a multi-purpose device, the Fire TV wins hands down and it's not even close. The Fire TV allows you the most customization, freedom and versatility, such as the ability to side-load apps. Both Roku sand Apple TV are locked tight in that regard. Fire TV also features a more baked in Prime experience. The Fire TV can be a little slow sometimes and can freeze occasionally (more so depending on what you install), but overall, not a bad box for the price.",2016-11-29T00:00:00.000Z,HARS

I absolutely love it! Of course asking questions about traffic, weather, recipes, etc. can be a blast, but I have to admit that my favorite part is being able to request any type of music I'm in the mood for, and even change my mind a few minutes later, without having to sort through CD's or putz around with the various 'plays' or radio stations on my phone or laptop. Definitely a gadget worth the money!!",2016-12-14T00:00:00.000Z,Jaxx

This device, although nice, currently has limited functions, especially considering the $200 price tag. So until more useful functions (linking to Google Now for instance) are added, I can only give my Echo as much as it pains me to do so, an average rating. Nice to have if you have extra cash sitting around and you don't mind waiting so see if useful functions will be added, but without Android syncing and functions,or the ability to control for example,TV channels, it's far from Amazon's usual ""gotta have it right now!"" category.",2016-05-22T00:00:00.000Z,bigred

AVphPmHuilAPnD_x3E5h,great e reader,4,Amazon,"The text is sharp and paper like in well lit conditions. When using the backlight in dark conditions it becomes less paper like but is quiet useful if you wanna ditch clip on lights. Can set on automatic brightness level or manually set. Slim and lightweight when not using a case which I appreciate most about this kindle. Makes for easy holding and carrying/packing. Practically any book at the palm of my hand on this one device. I also like that it has page press which is outer press buttons for page turning. One con is its not all that speedy and responsive when going though the store, though it is the fastest kindle yet. I would NOT say it is 80 to 100 dollars well spent over the paperweight. In fact i would recommend the paper weight when its come down to price. Im just someone who wants the best of the best so I bought 2 of these. One for my love as a gift, then I went and bought myself one. It was a well recieved gift and I aquired major browny points. We give them 4 thumbs up. We can read together in bed, in the woods, on the road or wherever we like. This is the voyager after all and it is intended to be with you wherever you go.

AV1YE_muvKc47QAVgpwE,Amazon Centric,3,Amazon Fire Tv,"Fire worked fine and was simple to set up. I must add, however, that the overview menu should have more than a few on-line locations (Apps) like Netflix and YouTube. It should work as a main menu whose apps include things like liveTV, DiscPlayer, and even phonograph. Instead, it is pretty much all-Amazon. At least, if it was easy to access, it was Amazon. Aliza was not all that helpful either for non-Amazon material, certainly not for TV shows that are not in the Amazon library. I think it is a mistake to make me change source to access almost anything but Amazon. I was spoiled by my previous (Old Sony) BluRay Disc Player that did indeed act like a central menu for everything -- including Amazon. I may be showing my age and ignorance here, but I bet I have lots of company. I say KISS for usage, even if it means a more complicated install.",2016-02-01T00:00:00.000Z,Dave

On the first one, one half of the screen had a white/blue tint and the other half was more of a yellow tint. When i flipped the device upside down to rotate to use with my other hand, half of the screen went much darker than the other. I returned it because I had read there were some that had lighting issues and bought another one. My second one was worse. You could see little half moons going down one side. That one also had a much yellower tint overall than the first one.I found it not easy to hold unless it was in the charging case. It was too slippery and, weird to say, small for me. I'm a female with average sized hands.I think what I really did love was the charging case and the size for transport purposes.

Overall, this tablet is a good value, but you have to be careful about certain aspects.The tablet is really fast for something in this price range. The screen has pretty good resolution as well. There is no Bluetooth connectivity so keyboards and wireless headphones won't work with it.The app store is the Amazon app store. I side loaded Google Play and am getting my apps from there (YouTube helpful for instructions). The lock screen is an Amazon billboard. The default search is Bing instead of Google. I haven't figured out how to fix that yet. I just use the Google app to search Google. You can load the Chromecast app from Play, but it is hit or miss as to whether it works. It works for YouTube and Flixter, but it doesn't work for any Disney Apps (Watch ESPN, Watch ABC, etc.). You can cast the screen and view things that way, but the resolution is limited to the resolution of the tablet's screen.I think it was a good deal since it was cheap, and I can now watch my Prime Movies on it. Still, it's not the tablet you would expect from an Android device. My satisfaction would improve greatly if Chromecast worked better.",2016-02-21T00:00:00.000Z,GAPINDY

I have a iPhone 6s and use Siri not as much as I would like too cuz she doesn't understand me all that great but Alexa? Man she understands every word I say like flawlessly. The reason why I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the Skills now even tho it's over 3000 skills a lot of them are junk people made I wish more big developers would make some. Should be well known Trivia games in here even if you had to buy them unless I'm not looking in the right place. The main thing I'll prolly use the Echo for is to listen to music it's real easy to Alexa to play a song and it sounds great,2016-11-16T00:00:00.000Z,GaryBTheTruth

AVphgVaX1cnluZ0-DR74,Better than expected,5,Amazon,"I haven't paid much attention to the Fire since the very first one out years back. But recently I purchased an Amazon Echo which I am thoroughly enjoying. And I discovered that my Echo was capable of 'voice casting.' This basically means that whatever Alexa is saying can show up as text or pictures on a screen (recipe or weather map, for example) and you can then print it out! So I wanted to explore voice casting and the easiest way to do that is with an Amazon Fire. What a deal! $50 for the most recent version that boasts all manner of things. I even get free movies! So I purchased a case for the Fire that would work as an easel stand, set it up as a photo frame displaying a rotating series of my digital photos, and whenever I want to I can voice cast from my Amazon Echo! Playing a music album? I can see the album cover and list of songs on my Fire. Checking what's playing at which movie theater when? I can voice cast that info so everyone can see it and vote. And we haven't even talked about using the Fire as an easy go-to for email or games!",2016-06-11T00:00:00.000Z,jlivar

Very different than my HDX BUT I HIGHLY RECOMMEND it! A little more pricey than the paperwhite BUT this one already comes with the case and a built in battery in the case so you are set for long time reading & the price is fair since the others you would still have to buy a case for it! Keep in mind the case for the oasis is leather and you can choose from black, brown and red (red was my choice., which to me it's not red it's more of a wine red color) it's beautiful! Picture shows My Kindle Oasis in the middle of the IPhone 7 Plus (left) & Samsung S8+ (right) so you can get an idea on the size... it's super cute!

AVqkIhwDv8e3D1O-lebb,Great little tablet,5,Amazon,"It's a great tablet for the price. Don't expect it to be as fast more expensive ones. It's meant for casual use and it does a great job at that. For the price, you can't beat it. Get a nice large microsd card and you don't have to worry about space. It runs a little slow on certain things if you are multitasking but it's a simple tablet. I've run plenty of 720p videos without fail. It's great for ebooks or other files. Some more elaborate pdfs take a while to load if they have a lol of graphics. Battery life seems good for a small table too.The only real Issue I have is the Amazon App store being limited. It is an offshoot of Android but not all the same apps are available. There is a way around it but I wish they would just allow it access to Google Play or at least offer the same apps.So, it's a nice inexpensive table that works great. For the money, you will love it but don't get upset that is doesn't run as fast as a $500 tablet. That's not its job.",2017-05-07T00:00:00.000Z,MRpopo

I would totally feel like Iron Man. Once you setup your iHeart Radio, Pandora Jam and Amazon Prime - your music possibilities are endless. It will also give you news headlines, weather, wake up alarms, etc. You can teach it skills such as telling jokes, random pick up lines or even pootering on demand. My kids love that it has a quite extensive poot library. (something I never thought i'd say) One warning! It gets expensive quick. I had it two days and was already back at Best Buy buying a Phillips Hue Starter Kit so I could control my bedroom lights by voice. Not mention that you can order using Amazon Prime by voice. Although some setup to do so is required. As far as the overall initial configuration is very easy.

AVpfl8cLLJeJML43AE3S,Just ok,2,Amazon,"I bought this to fill my life with music. The first two weeks were fantastic. I got Amazon Music, and needed only to say, ""Alexa, play (insert artist name, song name, or album name)"" and it would play music. The speaker quality is great. 4 days after Christmas it went into a Christmas Music and hymn default. Whatever artist I requested, it would play the first song, and then default to religious music. I'd switch artists and it'd happen again. I contacted Amazon, and was told not to request artists. I needed to specify albums and songs. I don't have this info memorized. I bought it to say artist names. Someone responding to my poor review on Amazon suggested trying different music services. I dumped Amazon music and started requesting music on Pandora. Alexa misunderstood my granddaughters request, and played Christmas music on Pandora, although we were now well into Jan. I'm no longer having the Christmas music problem, but Alexa is just ok playing music from Pandora. Sometimes it gets it right, sometimes not. I am so disappointed in it, that I plug it in when I want to hear music, and unplug it, and ignore it most of the time. When it worked the first two weeks, I raved about it. After witnessing my problems, people who come over don't want one.",2017-01-16T00:00:00.000Z,Unicornsinging

AVqVGZO3nnc1JgDc3jGK,Reasons I Love My Kindle Oasis,5,Amazon,"Even when I’m outside in bright sunlight, the words of the book I’m reading are still crystal clear. That alone makes the Kindle Oasis worth what it cost me.The Kindle Oasis wakes up in just seconds, and any book I choose instantly opens, ready to be read.It is the perfect size and isn’t heavy or bulky. I really do read for hours at a time. Sometimes I pace the floor while I read. Sometimes I’m on my elliptical machine when I read. And sometimes I’m sitting down. No matter what I’m doing, the Kindle Oasis remains comfortable to hold, and it is always easy on my eyes.When I receive a book that is in PDF, most of the time I can enlarge the words. If it won’t allow me to enlarge the words, I can change the orientation of the page and the words are automatically larger. I am able to make notes on the book if needed, and I can highlight words and/or passages.My merlot leather cover is attractive. When I flip it open, it is just like opening the cover of a book.How to Make the Battery LastOn the Kindle Oasis page, it says that its “dual-battery charging system delivers months of battery life.” This was a huge thing for me. Instead of having to charge my tablet almost every day, I would be able to read for months without charging the Kindle!Is this how my Oasis has performed? Well, not so much. There are conditions that have to be met for the charge on your Oasis to last for two months.First, you have to limit your reading to thirty minutes a day. That one is impossible for me. There are days that I am only able to read for thirty minutes, but they don’t occur very often. My Kindle goes everywhere with me, and I use just about every spare moment to read.Second, the wireless needs to be turned off. That one is easy to do but not always easy to remember. The only time the wireless needs to be on is to download one or more books.Third, this is based on your light setting at 10. That is way too low for me. I keep my light setting anywhere from 16 to 18.I don’t limit my reading to thirty minutes a day, and I try to remember to keep my wireless turned off. My light setting is kept anywhere from 16 to 18, and I put my Kindle to sleep the second I’m done reading. So how long does a single charge last me? Ten days is the longest a charge has lasted me so far, but it would have kept a charge for several more days if I had remembered to turn my wireless off. Once I succeed in keeping my wireless off, I will let you know how long the charge lasts.Now, I don’t plug it in to charge as soon as the charge on the cover gets low. I allow my cover charge to go as low as it will possibly go and then the Kindle battery will start to drain since it can no longer charge from the cover. I allow it to drain down to about 50% before I plug the cover and Kindle into my computer to charge.The one thing that surprised me was that everything on the Oasis is in black and white. For some reason, I thought that maybe the book covers would appear in color. But since I bought the Oasis to read books on, color isn’t needed.Special offers do appear on my screen but only when my Kindle is going to sleep or waking up. They aren’t a distraction, and to be honest, they are kind of fun to look at. You can pay a higher price so they won’t appear on your Kindle if you would rather not see them.I asked myself some questions once I had my Kindle and knew just how it worked. If I had known before I bought my Kindle Oasis that the charge wouldn’t last for months, would I still have bought it? Yes, I would have. If I had known that everything would appear in black and white, would I still have bought it? Yes, I would have.",2016-12-10T00:00:00.000Z,ljbinion

AV1YE_muvKc47QAVgpwE,Great for cutting cost on cable.,5,Amazon Fire Tv,"We bought the Fire TV box a few weeks ago to help save cost on cable tv. So far this has been a great alternative. We only have internet now and subscribe to Amazon Prime for around $100 a year. We subscribe to two other apps for $26 a month to get ESPN channels for basketball season and archived shows on CBS. The Fire TV box is easy to setup and use and there is also a Fire TV app that can be downloaded and used to control the box from a tablet or phone in addition to the Fire TV remote. There are thousands of tv shows and movies with the Amazon Prime subscription that are free.One nice feature is if we start a movie or show and don't finish one day we can go back the next day and resume where we left off. Another plus is the ""Alexa"" voice activated assistant to look up tv shows and movies and more just by asking. We have cut our cable cost by more than half. We did buy a digital antenna to get local tv in additon to the Fire TV box. So far we love our Fire TV.",2016-04-18T00:00:00.000Z,GotCoffee1

In order for my child to use audible I had to disable all of the family features and try to turn it into a reader... I was sad because there are lots of great family features that I had to disable.I did not use geek squad, I reached out directly to kindle support. Pre-sales, they could not tell me the difference between the free and paid family packages. I had to get to a senior person to help me figure be out why audible did not work and the to disable the family features ... even then, I could not disable the Alexa app. My child has full access to Alexa and the rights to turn on shopping.... kind of scary.So my disappointment is that Amazon does not make a kid friendly kindle that we can have audible.com on for my child's learning disability.",2017-06-02T00:00:00.000Z,DavidB

AVpe9CMS1cnluZ0-aoC5,I recieved it today!,4,Amazon,"I have had the Kindle Keyboard with it's lighted cover and now I have the new Kindle with lighted cover. I will briefly compare them and then list the pros and cons of this cover.In comparison:-The kindle keyboard in the cover is much heavier than the new kindle in it's cover. The new case does a much better job of securing the kindle as well, it is no longer hinged only on one edge, but instead it is form fit inside of a rigid rubber shell that attaches to the back of the new kindle-The lighting is about the same between both cases, but where the old case lit the screen from the top right corner, the new case lights the screen from the top middle.-I feel like the old light mechanism was more durable. The light bar on this cover is made out of very stiff, thin plastic instead of the thick rubbery plastic that contained the light on the old cover. It also hinges open instead of pulling out of the case, and the hinge feels subpar.-The light on the new case is less angled and tends to get in my eyes more when reading than the old kindle keyboard case did.All in all I still like the new case. It fits the new kindle very well and does not increase the size or weight very much. The leather is somewhat thin but not horribly so and it looks sleek on the kindle. I will be keeping this case.Pros:Compact case that looks very sleekTight and secure fitUses the Kindle's batteries so no additional power is needed.Provides adequate lighting across the entire screen.Cons:Lightbar hinge seems very cheap.Since I only received this today, I cannot yet evaluate the additional drain that this case will place on the Kindle's battery.Read more",,M.

You can safely use up to 5.25 watts and anything between .5 and 1 amp (500mA-1000mA).If you don't have an extra cell phone charger lying around just buy a well reviewed power adapter with the above specifications that connects to your Kindle (micro USB).

AVphLY7v1cnluZ0-_Ty0,Only good for your pocket.,1,Amazon,"Just got this as a Christmas gift and it doesn't stand.. Nothing to secure it to make it stand.. You can get it to stand maybe to watch a video, but don't touch it. It will fall down easily. Certainly don't stand it and actually use your Fire HD6 with this cover.. You can't.. Falls right over. I feel really badly for the special person that bought me this. Waste of money. I had already bought my own cover, for a lot cheaper, that has more shock protection and that one won't stand on end, but at sits securely at a tilt which makes it more useful for me. The cheaper one I bought on Amazon also has a magnetic closer to the cover stays closed. This one does not. Not sure how to tell the person who bought me this that I don't like this one at all. I'll feel bad telling them, and they'll feel bad hearing it. Bad all around.",2014-12-25T00:00:00Z,Atticus
